## General Steps

We have prepared an `.msi` file for Windows, example: `Conduktor-2.0.13.msi`.

The installer is an easy step by step installer that will install Conduktor in your `Program Files` folder, but you can change the destination as you wish.

Conduktor requires about 300MB of space on your hard drive.

You may be prompted to entire your admin credentials so that Conduktor can be installed

Conduktor is then installed.

In case you are prompted by the Windows Firewall, please make sure you enable access to private and public networks

Next step is to log into Conduktor
