# Mac OS X

## General Steps

We have prepared an `.pkg` file for Mac OS X, example: `Conduktor-2.0.13.pkg`.

The installer is an easy step by step installer that will install Conduktor in your `Applications` folder

Conduktor requires about 300MB of space on your hard drive.

You may be prompted to entire your admin credentials so that Conduktor can be installed

Conduktor is then installed.

Next step is to log into Conduktor

**[Sign in to Conduktor](/desktop/conduktor-first-steps/sign-in/)**
