# Conduktor Docs

- Use relative paths and traling slashes for links (e.g `/platform/testing/features/ci-cd-automation/` instead of `../../features/ci-cd-automation/`)
- If linking to a category page that doesn't have an index then use `/gateway/category/<category-name>` same for `/console/...`. 
- Production (main): https://docs.conduktor.io
