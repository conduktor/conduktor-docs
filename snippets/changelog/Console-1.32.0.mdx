### Breaking changes

#### Partner Zones
Improvements to Partner Zones require **Gateway 3.6.1 to be deployed** with this release of Console.
### Scale

#### Alert history

In the alert details page you can now also see the history of an alert's status and notifications which may have failed to send.

![Alert details page. The left-hand side lists alert properties like name and description. The right-hand side displays a heatmap-style chart with red and grey squares indicating alert health and a table below listing recent alert notifications.](/images/changelog/platform/v32/alert-details.png)


#### Audit logs

You can now view the new [CloudEvents-based](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md) audit log events with enhanced filtering capabilities for the new resource and event types, including Conduktor platform triggered events. 

While legacy audit log events will stop being captured in this release, existing legacy events will remain accessible through a dedicated page until a future release.

#### Service account labels

You can now edit labels on service accounts in plain Kafka clusters through the UI, in addition to the existing CLI & API support.

Support for labels on Aiven and Confluent Cloud service accounts is coming soon.

![The service account details page shows labels underneath the service account name heading. Next to existing labels there is an edit button which you can click to open a drawer with a form to add and edit labels](/images/changelog/platform/v32/edit-service-account-labels.png)

#### RBAC-aware menu

The left-hand menu is now RBAC (Role Based Access Control) aware, dynamically showing/hiding menu items based on users' permissions. Hiding functionality that users don't have access to makes onboarding easier and reduces confusion.

In Console, menu items are shown based on the user's `Resource access` permissions on individual clusters, while the **Settings** menu items are shown according to the `Service access` permissions.


### Exchange

Exchange is a **new Conduktor product** that enables you to **share data securely** with your external partners. [Find out more about the Exchange product](https://conduktor.io/exchange).

#### Introducing Partner Zones UI

<Warning>
Partner Zones is currently a Preview feature and is subject to change as we continue working on it.
</Warning>

Partner Zones enable you to securely share your Kafka streaming data with external partners, without the need to replicate that data into a second, physical Kafka cluster.

In this release we're introducing the option to create Partner Zones using the Console UI in just few steps, including the ability to set traffic control policies.

In upcoming releases we'll be adding further enhancements, such as:
- an ability to edit Partner Zone configurations
- the option to rename shared topics, securing your data even further by ensuring that no internal information is shared

### Quality of life improvements

- Enabled the confirmation of resource deletion using the **Enter** key.
- Updated the connector restart button labels and toast messages to accurately reflect their behavior for Confluent Cloud connectors.
- Removed a legacy option to disable monitoring.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where editing a schema registry subject would overwrite its compatibility mode with the global compatibility setting.
- Fixed an issue where creating an ACL for a service account with a duplicate name could override the existing ACL.
- Fixed an issue where you could not remove the last ACL and Save in the Service Account UI.
- Fixed an issue where the Kafka Connect failed task heatmap didn't display data for days in 2025.
- Fixed an issue where the CLI would report incorrect actions taken (although the correct actions were shown when the `--dry-run` flag was used).
- When Azure Active Directory is used as an LDAP server, the `userPrincipalName` field can now be set as the field containing the email address.
- Fixed an issue where very large numbers would show rounded in the details view of a topic message (e.g. `7777705807840271771` would display as `7777705807840271000`).
- Fixed the UI issue where the option to reset a consumer group offset would disappear off the screen, if the partition count was too large.

### Known issues
In the Topic Consume view, equality filters (`==`) on JSON number fields isn't working correctly when the number exceeds JavaScript's safe integer limit of `2^53-1`. Note that while range operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) still work with large numbers, there's currently no workaround for exact equality filtering. We'll address this in a future release.
