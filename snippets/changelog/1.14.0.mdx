### Important changes

- This version requires a configuration update to ensure you have root administrator defined. This is mandatory for initialization of the platform, therefore you **MUST** update your configuration prior to upgrading.

### Features

Give us feedback [here](https://conduktor.io/roadmap)

- **Platform**

  - See important changes above. You must ensure you have a root administrator defined in your platform configuration.
  - New onboarding wizard to help setup your environment for a new installation. This can be used to configure license, organization, database and SSO (Oauth2/LDAP) from inside the Conduktor UI. See [docs](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/installation/get-started/docker/).
  - Added a memory available check at startup to prevent platform running in cases whereby the memory available is less than the memory required by the `RUN_MODE` being used.

- **Console**

  - Long resource names are now wrapped to ensure the full string is always visible in the table.
  - We have improved the performance of loading topic names and associated metadata in the topic list screen.
  - We have improved the performance for loading subjects from schema registry.

- **Admin**
  
  - It's now possible to add an SSO user to your organization before their first login. This allows you to allocate appropriate permissions prior to their first login. 
  - Notifications screen is now 'Integrations', with support added for Microsoft Teams. 
  
- **Monitoring**

  - Request confirmation from users when deleting alerts.
  - Reduced verbosity of logs from the topic scanner.
  - Integration of Microsoft Teams notifications for alerting.

### Fixes

- **Platform**

  - Clean some embedded PostgreSQL temporary files on container restart to prevent database startup error in some edge cases.
  - Remove `Content-Length` header on web-socket requests, mitigating web-socket issues with some reverse proxy like Envoy.

- **Console**

  - Fix dropdown selectors in dark mode theme.
  - Consumer: pretty print Protobuf records

- **Testing**

  - Fix variable definition export.
  - Fix deletion of linked tasks.
