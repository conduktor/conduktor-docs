# Conduktor 1.7.0

Discover the latest version of Conduktor in 1.7.0, featuring a new diagnostic tool for Docker and exciting enhancements in the Console. The Platform introduces a diagnostic tool to help troubleshoot any issues you may encounter. Find detailed instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/troubleshooting/debugging/). In the Console, the Consumer Groups now offer a "Preview Table" in the "Reset Offsets" feature, allowing you to visualize the impact of your request before executing it. The Schema Registry gains support for all possible naming strategies, including Topic Name, Record Name, Topic + Record Name, and Custom. Additionally, the Admin section now displays error notifications when the "Test Connection" fails. This version also includes various fixes addressing LDAP group mapping, UI improvements, and faster timeout for the "Test Connection" button. Please note that some broken links to the old documentation site will be resolved in the next release.

    - Custom

### Fix üî®

- **Platform**

  - Fix LDAP group mapping

- **Console**

  - Consume: The graph now displays time in a 24h format
  - Produce: It was not possible to change the Charset when producing Strings
  - Topics List: The table was needlessly refreshing the data when changing the Topic name truncation
  - Schema Registry - Subjects list: We now display a "‚ö†Ô∏è" icon when a Subject has an issue instead of showing a less useful and noisy error notification

- **Admin**
  - The "Test Connection" button on the Kafka Cluster & Kafka connect configuration page timeouts faster (5 seconds)

### Additional Notes üìù

  - There are a number of broken links that still point to our old documentation site (docs.testing.conduktor.io).
