*Release date: 2025-06-23*

### Changes

*Note this release introduced a couple of bugs that were fixed in `v0.6.1`, please use this instead of `v0.6.0` where possible.*

- Significant performance improvements when applying a large number of resources. Control the maximum number of concurrent resource `apply` operations with the `--parallelism` flag.
  - The flag accepts integer values between 1 and 100. If a value outside this range is provided, the command will print an error and exit.
