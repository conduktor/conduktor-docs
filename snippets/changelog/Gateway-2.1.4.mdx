*Release date: 2023-09-13*

### Features âœ¨

#### Support OAuth SASL Mechanism

We now support OAuth allowing you to connect clients without having to change from your existing authentication setup. For more info on setup checkout the docs or contact us directly.

#### Security provider / FIPS

New encryption security providers are now available when encrypting data. 
The security provider is set via a feature flag `GATEWAY_SECURITY_PROVIDER`, and the options available are: 

* [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/)
* [Bouncy Castle with FIPS](https://www.bouncycastle.org/documentation/documentation-java/#bouncy-castle-java-fips-documentation)
* [Conscrypt](https://www.conscrypt.org/)

You can now be [FIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards) compliant when doing field level encryption

#### REST Audit

All admin API calls are now logged in the audit log.

#### Dynamic port allocation 

When not defined the `GATEWAY_PORT_COUNT` variable is now computed on the fly, rather than static allocation on start. 
Note that the recommended production value is double the number of Kafka brokers.

#### Support all properties when protecting topics

When putting interceptors in place to protect the creation of topics, or altering of topics, we have expanded our support for policies to be defined by all properties in the [Kafka topic configs](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs). 


#### SCRAM Passthrough

Gateway's passthrough mode has been expanded to support `SASL_SCRAM`.
