#### Automatic connector restarts (Preview feature)

Failed Connector tasks could already be restarted from within Console at the click of a button.

Simply navigate to the instance of interest, click into it and from here you can manually restart.

Being able to manually restart from our UI without having to look elsewhere in your Kafka ecosystem is powerful, but we now have the ability for **automatic** connector restarts to be enabled!

You can configure Console to attempt to restart failed tasks as frequently as every ten minutes. If they are failing more frequently than this we suspect you have bigger issues to look into. 👀

And if that wasn't enough, we even differentiate between automatic and manual restarts within the `connector.RestartedTask` audit event.

#### New Home experience

The Console home experience has been reworked to get you where you want to go quickly!

From the homepage you can now jump straight into connecting your clusters, viewing your most recent topics, or managing users, groups and permissions. You will also find a few more handy quick links 👀

#### Configurable max session lifetime

You can now configure the maximum session lifetime for your users. This means your users will be forced to re-authenticate after a maximum period that you define.

See the [documentation](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/env-variables//#session-lifetime-properties) on how to configure this value. Note that the current default value is set to 3 days.

#### New 'by broker view'

We have now added a new view in the Topics > Partitions tab that enables you to see a breakdown of partition leaders and partition replicas at a broker level.

#### Show offsets in Consumer Group details

The Consumer Group details page has now been enriched with the 'End Offset' and the 'Committed Offset' for each Topic and Partition.

#### Fixes

- Fix the JQ filter in Console
- Fix showing metrics for consumer groups with blank name
- Slack channel alerting now supports 500 channels, previously it was restricted at 100

### Monitoring

#### Features

#### Object storage support for external storage

You can now configure monitoring to export data to other additional object storage providers such as GCS, Azure and Swift. This builds on what was previously only support for S3.

#### Fixes 🔨

#### Alert channel list increased to 500

- Fixed an issue when settting up alerts you could only pick from the first 100 channels that were available, now the list allows selection from up to 500.
