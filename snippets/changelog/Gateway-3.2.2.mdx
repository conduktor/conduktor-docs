title: Hotfix for Gateway 3.2.2
---

### Upcoming Breaking change 

<Info>
This breaking change only impacts Local Gateway service accounts generated through our token endpoints:
- `POST /admin/username/{username}`
- `POST /admin/vclusters/v1/vcluster/{vcluster}/username/{username}`

If you are not using Local Gateway services accounts (OIDC, mTLS, Delegated Kafka), you are **not** impacted.
</Info>

Today, the token as the password for local Gateway service accounts contains all the necessary information. As a result, the SASL username is not used during the authentication phase.  
In an **upcoming** release, we will strictly enforce that the username and the token matches. This will help reduce inconsistencies and avoid unexpected behaviors.

**This breaking change is due for release 3.5.0.**   
For this hotfix release 3.2.2, and next product releases 3.3.0 and 3.4.0s, we'll only raise the following warning in the logs:  
````
2024-08-27T18:15:29 [WARN] - Inconsistency detected for plain authentication. Username applicationA is not consistent with validated token created for application-A. SASL configuration should be changed accordingly.
````

### General fixes 🔨

- Fixed a **severe** authentication issue with Gateway generated tokens that could lead to a different user being authenticated, effectively causing elevated privileges under certain conditions.
- Fixed an issue where `GATEWAY_SNI_HOST_SEPARATOR` couldn't be set to the value `-`
- Fixed an issue where `GATEWAY_SNI_HOST_SEPARATOR` wasn't properly taken in account
- Fixed an issue with `GATEWAY_ADVERTISED_SNI_PORT` that wasn't working properly
