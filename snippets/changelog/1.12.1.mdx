### Important changes

- This version will delete existing user-defined alerts as the data in Cortex changed significantly with the switch towards agent-less monitoring

### Features

Give us feedback [here](https://conduktor.io/roadmap)

- **Platform**

  - Remove the default 'localhost:9092' cluster from Admin when starting Platform
  - Remove extra local user user@conduktor.io from default platform configuration
  - Print configuration resolution at platform startup if `CDK_ROOT_LOG_LEVEL` or `PLATFORM_STARTUP_LOG_LEVEL` are set to `DEBUG`. See [configuration properties and environment variables](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/env-variables/)
  - Added missing EXPOSE directive with default platform port 8080 to the Dockerfile

- **Console**

  - RBAC: Support for Kafka Connect. See [docs](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/navigation/settings/rbac/)
  - Schema registry: Support mTLS connection for Confluent schema registry. See [docs](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/ssl-tls-configuration/)
  - Schema registry: Support SSL truststore configured via advanced properties
