  - Remove extra local user user@conduktor.io from default platform configuration
  - Print configuration resolution at platform startup if `CDK_ROOT_LOG_LEVEL` or `PLATFORM_STARTUP_LOG_LEVEL` are set to `DEBUG`. See [configuration properties and environment variables](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/env-variables/)
