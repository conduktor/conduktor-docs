### Breaking changes

#### Deprecating v1 APIs

The v1 APIs are now deprecated in favor of v2, introduced in Gateway v3.3.0 in September 2024.  

If you're using the Conduktor CLI to operate Gateway, you're not impacted. [Find out which Gateway APIs are affected](https://developers.conduktor.io/?product=gateway&version=3.6.1&gatewayApiVersion=v1).

<Warning>
If you're using the v1 APIs, migrate to v2 APIs as soon as possible. [Get in touch](https://support.conduktor.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new?ticket_form_id=17438363566609) for support with the migration.
</Warning>

#### New APIs for health and versions

To improve the reliability and monitoring of the Gateway service, we've introduced new API endpoints for health checks and version information.

These changes align our service with Kubernetes health check standards and will provide a more robust way to monitor Gateway's status.

[Find out more from the monitoring reference](/guide/conduktor-in-production/monitor/index#liveness-endpoint).

<Warning>
The old */health* API is now deprecated but it will continue to function. 

Please update your configuration to use the new liveness and readiness probe endpoints.
</Warning>

#### Configuration key change for Vault KUBERNETES authentication type

The [Vault KUBERNETES authentication type](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/autoauth/methods/kubernetes#token_path) has been corrected to read the token from a file in the running pod.

Because of this, Kubernetes authentication's configuration key `jwt` (`VAULT_KUBERNETES_JWT`) was changed to `path` (`VAULT_KUBERNETES_PATH`). 

This *optional* configuration contains the path of the file containing the token. It defaults to `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` following the Vault documentation.

#### Rename of Virtual Cluster Id

When a Kafka client requests the cluster Id of a Virtual Cluster through Gateway, the returned cluster Id will be different - it will be renamed.

Previously, the returned cluster Id was the native Kafka cluster Id of the Virtual Cluster's physical cluster.

The new cluster Id that's returned will be be in the form of: `{virtual-cluster-name}@{physical-cluster-id}`.

### New features

#### New `GATEWAY_AUDIT_LOG_EVENT_TYPES` environment variable

This release introduces the `GATEWAY_AUDIT_LOG_EVENT_TYPES` environment variable which controls the types of events recorded in the audit log.

It provides flexibility to enable/disable specific event types, such as `CONNECTION`. 

[See the full list and explanations of the event types](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-gateway/env-variables#audit).

This change is backwards compatible, as the default value is `ALL` (which means that all event types are logged by default).

#### Enhanced crypto shredding behavior for decryption
The decryption Interceptor now includes improved error handling behavior specifically for crypto shredding scenarios.

A new `crypto_shred_safe_fail_fetch` error policy has been introduced. It returns encrypted data when decryption fails due to missing encryption keys, but throws exceptions for other types of decryption failures (e.g., authentication errors). This ensures that crypto-shredded data remains protected while still failing fast for other issues that require attention.
