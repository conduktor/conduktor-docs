# Gateway 3.12.0

- [Breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
- [New features](#new-features)

### Breaking changes

#### New APIs for health and versions

To improve the reliability and monitoring of the Gateway service, we've introduced new API endpoints for health checks and version information.

These changes align our service with Kubernetes health check standards and will provide a more robust way to monitor Gateway's status.

[Find out more from the monitoring reference](/guide/conduktor-in-production/monitor/index#liveness-endpoint).

<Warning>
The old */health* API is now deprecated but it will continue to function. 

Please update your configuration to use the new liveness and readiness probe endpoints.
</Warning>

### New features

#### New `GATEWAY_AUDIT_LOG_EVENT_TYPES` environment variable

This release introduces the `GATEWAY_AUDIT_LOG_EVENT_TYPES` environment variable which controls the types of event types recorded in the audit log.

It provides flexibility to enable or disable specific event types, such as `CONNECTION`. 

[See the full list and explanations of the event types](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-gateway/env-variables#audit).

This change is backwards compatible, as the default value is `ALL` (which means that all event types are logged by default).
