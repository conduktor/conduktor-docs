### Breaking changes

#### Removed V1 Alerts
Original alerts created in the Monitoring/Alerts section are no longer available.

#### Changes to V2 Alerts
V2 Alerts, that can be created since Console 1.28 on the dedicated resource page (Topics, Brokers, etc.) are still available and active, but have been migrated with the following rules:
- Alerts have been automatically configured with the previously globally configured channel (Teams or Slack).
- Alerts have been assigned to the individual who created them.

Read [below](#enhanced-alerting-with-added-webhooks-support) for more information about the new alerting functionality.

#### Id of Certificates
The Id of certificates in the ```public/v1/certificates``` API endpoints were modified to represent the fingerprint of the certificate.
It brings a more stable way to identify certificates in audit log and prevent multiple uploads of the same certificate.

### Scale

#### Enhanced Alerting with Added Webhooks Support

We have made significant improvements to the alerting system in Console.  
Here are some of the changes:
- Alerts are now **owned** by individuals, groups, or applications
- We added **Webhook** destination to alerts notifications
- Destinations are now configurable per-alert
- API / CLI support for Alerts is now available

````yaml
apiVersion: console/v3
kind: Alert
metadata:
  name: messages-in-dead-letter-queue
  group: support-team
spec:
  cluster: my-dev-cluster
  type: TopicAlert
  topicName: wikipedia-parsed-DLQ
  metric: MessageCount
  operator: GreaterThan
  threshold: 0
  destination:
    type: Slack
    channel: "alerts-p1"
````
Alert creation workflow has been updated to allow you to configure the alert destination and ownership in the UI.

#### API / CLI support for Service Accounts
We have added support for Service Accounts in the API and CLI.  
Declaring ServiceAccount resource lets you manage the ACLs of a service account in Kafka.  
At the moment we only support Kafka ACLs (calls to Kafka APIs) but we plan to add support for Aiven ACLs in ServiceAccount resource in the future. 
````yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  cluster: shadow-it
  name: clickstream-sa
spec:
  authorization:
    type: KAFKA_ACL
    acls:
      - type: TOPIC
        name: click.event-stream.avro
        patternType: PREFIXED
        operations:
          - Write
      - type: CLUSTER
        name: kafka-cluster
        patternType: LITERAL
        operations:
          - DescribeConfigs
      - type: CONSUMER_GROUP
        name: cg-name
        patternType: LITERAL
        operations:
          - Read
````

#### Labels support for Service Accounts
We have added support for labels in the ServiceAccount resource.  
For now you can only edit labels through ServiceAccount resource in the API and CLI.
````yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  cluster: shadow-it
  name: clickstream-sa
  labels:
    domain: payment
    region: EMEA
    application: clickstream
spec:
  ...
````
The labels are used to filter the Service Accounts in the UI. Editing labels in the UI will be available in the next release.

#### Self-service support for Application Managed Service Accounts
We have added a new mode for ApplicationInstance that allows Application Teams to have full control over their Service Accounts.  
This mode can be enabled in the ApplicationInstance with the following flag `spec.applicationManagedServiceAccount` set to `true`.  
When enabled, Self-service will not synchronize the Service Account with the ApplicationInstance and will let the Application Team manage the Service Account directly.
Application Managed Service Accounts can be declared in the API and CLI using the Application API Key.
````yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  appInstance: "clickstream-app-dev" # Mandatory to link the Service Account to the ApplicationInstance
  cluster: shadow-it
  name: clickstream-sa
spec:
  authorization:
    type: KAFKA_ACL
    acls:
...
````

####  Application Group permissions now available on Users Permissions page

The users permissions page has been updated to show the permissions inherited when they belong to an ApplicationGroup.

### Exchange

**Exchange** is a new Conduktor Product aimed at helping you share your data securely with your external partners.  
Check the associated [Exchange Product page](https://conduktor.io/exchange) for more information.

#### Introducing Partner Zones for Third-Party Data Sharing

<Info>
Partner Zones is currently a Preview feature and is subject to change as we continue working on it.
</Info>

Partner Zones enable you to securely share your streaming data with external partners, without needing to replicate the data into a second, physical Kafka cluster.

In the upcoming releases, we will be adding the following:
- Dedicated pages that allows you to manage Partner Zones completely from the UI
- Support for Traffic Control Policies to limit the amount of data that can be consumed or produced by your partners
- Topic renaming capability to avoid leaking internal topic names to your partners

[Find out more about Partner Zones](/guide/conduktor-concepts/partner-zones).

### Quality of Life improvements
