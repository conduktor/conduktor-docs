### Conduktor Scale

### Conduktor Exchange

#### Partner Zone out of preview

Partner Zones are now generally available and out of preview. This means that all features are fully supported, production-ready, and can be used in production environments. This will be identified in the Console UI with the "Preview" tag being removed.

#### Partner Zone multi-cluster

Console now supports creating Partner Zones against a multi-clustered Gateway configuration. This allows for a Partner Zone to be created against any of the configured Kafka clusters behind Gateway (previously, a Gateway was required per Kafka cluster for a Partner Zone).

[Check out the tutorial on creating Partner Zones with multi-cluster Gateway](/guide/tutorials/partner-zone-multi-cluster).

#### Breaking change

With support for Partner Zones on multi-cluster Gateway configurations, Partner Zones now have a breaking change: all **existing Partner Zones must be re-created** to take advantage of this capability.

We strongly recommend doing this now, as Partner Zones are out of preview, to ensure your Partner Zones are properly configured for the new multi-cluster support.

### Conduktor Trust

#### Regex library

Added an option to **Show regex library** when creating a new Rule in Console. This provides a list of pre-built regex examples that can be used to speed up Rule creation.

### Quality of life improvements

You can now fine-tune Cortex and Prometheus retention with the new environment variables. We've also updated the default values to reduce disk usage.

You can **patch** (instead of replacing) the YAML configuration. [Find out more about overriding the configuration with YAML](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-cortex#overriding-with-yaml).

### Fixes

- Fixed production rate metrics getting stuck at high values when producer rates drop instantly to zero, which was causing artificially inflated metrics in systems with bursty production patterns
- Errors preventing users from logging in are now prominently displayed on the login page
- The Trust Rules and Policies pages are now hidden for users without [Trust](https://conduktor.io/trust) in their license
- Kafka Cluster configuration for SSL passwords no longer displays length unless editing the field, and AWS Glue secrets are no longer clear text.
