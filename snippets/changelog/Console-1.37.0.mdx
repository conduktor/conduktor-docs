### Breaking change: email address storage
In this release, we have made a change to how we store the email addresses of users in Console.
All emails are now stored in lowercase to ensure consistency and prevent issues with SSO or RBAC.
We highly recommend that you back up your Console database before upgrading to this version.
If two users have the same email address but with different cases, the migration will fail.
In this case, we recommend that you resolve the conflict by either deleting one of the users or changing their email address before upgrading.


### Conduktor Scale

#### Application groups management

New application group management in Self-service provides full lifecycle management through improved UI workflows.

The **Members** tab offers an enhanced interface for managing group membership, making it easier for teams to control access and visibility. The **Resource access** tab enables granular control over topic, consumer group, subject, and connector permissions for precise access management. Application groups can also map to external groups like Console user groups for streamlined access management.

#### Application Instance resources

Application instances now feature comprehensive resource management capabilities. The new **Resources** tab provides a detailed view of all the resources associated with application instances, giving teams better visibility into their resource usage and dependencies.

#### Subject strategies support

Support for **Confluent subject strategies** has been added to the produce page for topics. This enhancement gives users more control over how schemas are referenced when producing messages, providing flexibility in schema organization and naming conventions.

#### External Group management improvements

The **External groups UI** has been enhanced for mapping external authentication groups, making it easier for administrators to configure and maintain user access patterns.

Both the Console user groups and application groups now support **external group regex** functionality, enabling dynamic group assignment based on external authentication patterns. This allows organizations to automatically map users from identity providers to appropriate application groups, based on configurable regex patterns.

### Conduktor Exchange

#### Partner Zone out of preview

Partner Zones are now generally available and out of preview. This means that all features are fully supported, production-ready, and can be used in production environments.

#### Partner Zone multi-cluster support

Console now supports creating Partner Zones against a multi-clustered Gateway configuration. This allows for a Partner Zone to be created against any of the configured Kafka clusters behind Gateway (previously, a Gateway was required per Kafka cluster for a Partner Zone).

[Check out the tutorial on creating Partner Zones with multi-cluster Gateway](/guide/tutorials/partner-zone-multi-cluster), as well as the [console resources for Partner Zones](/guide/reference/console-reference#partner-zones).

#### Partner Zone breaking change

With the support for multi-cluster Gateway, all existing Partner Zones created prior to this version of Console are incompatible and cannot be migrated or updated to support the new capability. Hence, existing Partner Zones will stop functioning after the upgrade if not recreated.

**Action required:**

- Delete all existing Partner Zones before upgrading
- Upgrade Console and Gateway to the latest version
- Recreate the Partner Zones with the same configuration

### Conduktor Trust

#### Regex library

Added an option to **Show regex library** when creating a new rule in Console. This provides a list of pre-built regex examples that can be used to speed up rule creation.

#### Mark action

You can now toggle the **Mark action** on data quality Policies. When enabled, messages that violate the rule(s) are tagged with a special header.

[Check out the Mark action use case.](/guide/use-cases/enforce-data-quality#mark-action)

#### JSON schema rule type

You can now create JSON schema rules to validate message structure and content.

[Check out the JSON schema use case.](/guide/use-cases/enforce-data-quality#json-schema-rule)

### Quality of life improvements

You can now fine-tune Cortex and Prometheus retention with the new environment variables. We've also updated the default values to reduce disk usage.

You can **patch** (instead of replacing) the YAML configuration. [Find out more about overriding the configuration with YAML](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-cortex#overriding-with-yaml).

The Self-service experience has been improved with **updated terminology** for managing access requests.

Ambiguous and inconsistent references to various terminology such as 'subscriptions', 'subscribing', 'access requests', 'sharing', 'requests', have been standardized throughout the application, placing emphasis on a single unified concept of **access request**.

You can now view the Resource Policies in the Application details page, and the Consumer Group ownerships in the Application instance details page.

### Fixes

- Fixed production rate metrics getting stuck at high values when producer rates drop instantly to zero, which was causing artificially inflated metrics in systems with bursty production patterns.
- Errors preventing users from logging in are now prominently displayed on the login page.
- The Trust Rules and Policies pages are now hidden for users without [Trust](https://conduktor.io/trust) in their license.
- Kafka Cluster configuration for SSL passwords no longer displays length unless editing the field, and AWS Glue secrets are no longer clear text.
