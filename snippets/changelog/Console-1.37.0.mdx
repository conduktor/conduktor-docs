### Conduktor Scale

### Conduktor Exchange

#### Breaking change

With support for Partner Zones on multi cluster Gateway configurations, Partner Zones now have a breaking change: all **existing Partner Zones have to be re-created** to take advantage of this capability.
We recommend doing this now, whilst Partner Zone configurations are not in production.

#### Partner Zone multi-cluster

Console now supports creating Partner Zones against a multi-clustered Gateway configuration. This allows for a Partner Zone against any of the configured Kafka clusters behind the Gateway.
Previously, a Gateway was required per Kafka cluster for a Partner Zone.

To see how to set this up, please see our [partner zone multi-cluster guide](/guide/tutorials/partner-zone-multi-cluster)   

### Conduktor Trust

#### Regex library
Added an option to **Show regex library** when creating a new Rule in Console. This provides a list of pre-built regex examples that can be used to speed up Rule creation.
