### Conduktor Scale

### Conduktor Exchange

### Conduktor Trust

#### Regex library

Added an option to **Show regex library** when creating a new Rule in Console. This provides a list of pre-built regex examples that can be used to speed up Rule creation.

### Quality of life improvements

You can now fine-tune Cortex and Prometheus retention with the new environment variables. We've also updated the default values to reduce disk usage.

You can **patch** (instead of replacing) the YAML configuration. [Find out more about overriding the configuration with YAML](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-cortex#overriding-with-yaml).

### Fixes
 - Fixed production rate metrics getting stuck at high values when producer rates drop instantly to zero, which was causing artificially inflated metrics in systems with bursty production patterns
 - Errors preventing users from logging in are now prominently displayed on the login page
 - The Trust Rules and Policies pages are now hidden for users without Trust in their license
