### Conduktor Scale

### Conduktor Exchange

### Conduktor Trust

#### Regex library
Added an option to **Show regex library** when creating a new Rule in Console. This provides a list of pre-built regex examples that can be used to speed up Rule creation.

### Quality of life improvements

### Fixes
 - Fixed production rate metrics getting stuck at high values when producer rates drop instantly to zero, which was causing artificially inflated metrics in systems with bursty production patterns
