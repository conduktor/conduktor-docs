### Conduktor Scale

#### Application groups management

New application group management in Self-service provides full lifecycle management through improved UI workflows.

The **Members** tab offers an enhanced interface for managing group membership, making it easier for teams to control access and visibility. The **Resource access** tab enables granular control over topic, consumer group, subject, and connector permissions for precise access management. Application groups can also map to external groups like Console user groups for streamlined access management. 

#### Application Instance resources

Application instances now feature comprehensive resource management capabilities. The new **Resources** tab provides a detailed view of all the resources associated with application instances, giving teams better visibility into their resource usage and dependencies.


#### Subject strategies support

Support for **Confluent subject strategies** has been added to the produce page for topics. This enhancement gives users more control over how schemas are referenced when producing messages, providing flexibility in schema organization and naming conventions.


#### External Group management improvements

The **External groups UI** has been enhanced for mapping external authentication groups, making it easier for administrators to configure and maintain user access patterns.

Both the Console user groups and application groups now support **external group regex** functionality, enabling dynamic group assignment based on external authentication patterns. This allows organizations to automatically map users from identity providers to appropriate application groups, based on configurable regex patterns.

### Conduktor Exchange

### Conduktor Trust

#### Regex library

Added an option to **Show regex library** when creating a new Rule in Console. This provides a list of pre-built regex examples that can be used to speed up Rule creation.

### Quality of life improvements

You can now fine-tune Cortex and Prometheus retention with the new environment variables. We've also updated the default values to reduce disk usage.

You can **patch** (instead of replacing) the YAML configuration. [Find out more about overriding the configuration with YAML](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-cortex#overriding-with-yaml).

The Self-service experience has been improved with **updated terminology** for managing access requests. 

Ambiguous and inconsistent references to various terminology such as 'subscriptions', 'subscribing', 'access requests', 'sharing', 'requests', have been standardized throughout the application, placing emphasis on a single unified concept of **access request**.

You can now view the Resource Policies in the Application details page, and the Consumer Group ownerships in the Application instance details page.


### Fixes

- Fixed production rate metrics getting stuck at high values when producer rates drop instantly to zero, which was causing artificially inflated metrics in systems with bursty production patterns.
- Errors preventing users from logging in are now prominently displayed on the login page.
- The Trust Rules and Policies pages are now hidden for users without [Trust](https://conduktor.io/trust) in their license.
