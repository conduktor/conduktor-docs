title: Gateway 3.6.1
---

### New features

- New metric `gateway.apiKeys.throttle_ms` : sets the throttling time in Kafka responses per apiKey in milliseconds
- Updated existing metric `gateway.apiKeys.latency.request_response` : sets the latency to process a request and generate a response for each API key
  - It now tracks latency for all verbs (eg CONNECTION) not just FETCH/PRODUCE

### Feature changes

- Changes to `Limit Commit Offset Plugin`:
  - accuracy of rate limiting has been improved
  - `action`/`throttleTimeInMs` properties did not work correctly and are now ignored
- Changes to `cluster ACLs`:
  - when creating cluster ACLs using a programmatic API, only allow `kafka-cluster` for the name part of the resource. This makes Gateway consistent with Kafka.

### Fixes

- Fixed a problem with the Create Topic Policy plugin which would not apply overrides to default configurations from the underlying Kafka setup.
- Fixed a problem with `CreateTopics ACLs` in Gateway which previously also required the `Create cluster` permission enabled.
- Addressed a problem with Non Delegated SASL/PLAIN token credentials, where Gateway would continue to work after service account has been deleted. To enable this feature set the environment variable `GATEWAY_USER_POOL_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_REQUIRED` to `true` (it currently defaults to `false`).
- Fixed a problem in `AddPartitionsToTxnRequest` where ACLs on transactionIds in new location were not being checked when Kafka API version was >= 4.
- An un-authorized idempotent producer will now throw a `ClusterAuthorizationException` instead of a `TransactionalIdAuthorizationException`, making Conduktor Gateway consistent with Kafka.
