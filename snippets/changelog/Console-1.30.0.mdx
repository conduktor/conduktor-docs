### Features

#### RBAC support for Conduktor SQL

In a previous release, we introduced Conduktor SQL. It was restricted to Admins because it did not apply any permission model.

This new update brings full RBAC support on Conduktor SQL:

- Users & Groups can only see and query the tables for which they have an associated Topic permission in Console
- Data masking policies are applied (with limitations)

You can now bring SQL to all users within your organization.

For more detailed information, check out the [SQL security](/platform/guide/configure-sql#sql-security) section.

#### Add support for multi-hosts database configuration

You can now setup Console's backing database for high availability(HA). If you have a PostgreSQL HA setup with multiple hosts, you can now configure a Console to [JDBC connection](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/use/#connection-fail-over) to the database using a list of hosts.

```yaml
CDK_DATABASE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://user:password@host1:5432,host2:5433/console_database
CDK_KAFKASQL_DATABASE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://user:password@host1:5432,host2:5433/kafka_sql_database
```

For more information, check out the [Multi-host configuration](/platform/get-started/configuration/database/#multi-host-configuration) section in the Database configuration documentation.

#### Delegating authentication to an identity provider

Console can now be configured to accept a JWT token from an external identity provider.
It allows you to directly use your identity provider for managing access to Console.
A common use case of this feature is to delegate authentication to your API gateway.

For the full configuration details, check out the [documentation](/platform/get-started/configuration/user-authentication/jwt-auth).

#### More Audit Log CloudEvents into Kafka

We have made more events available for the Audit Log Publisher:

- Kafka.Subject.ChangeCompatibility
- Kafka.Topic.Browse
- Kafka.Topic.ProduceRecord
- Kafka.Topic.SqlQuery
- Kafka.Connector.Restart
- Kafka.Connector.Pause
- Kafka.Connector.Resume
- Kafka.Connector.RestartTask
- Kafka.Connector.AutoRestartActivate
- Kafka.Connector.AutoRestartStop

A full list of all the exported audit log event types is published on the [Audit Log](/platform/navigation/settings/audit-log/#exportable-audit-log-events) page.

### Quality of Life improvements

- Alert lists in the resource pages have been updated to show the metric and condition, the alert state and a new column "Last Triggered"
- Chargeback data can now be exported into a CSV file to enable easier integration with existing organization cost management data.
- The User permission page provides a clearer distinction between inherited and user-specific permissions.
- Topic policy validation errors message are easier to read when using the CLI
- Added support for Array and Boolean types in Conduktor SQL
- Added Kafka Key column and other metadata in Conduktor SQL Topics ([Full list](/platform/guide/configure-sql/#database-storage-format))

### Fixes

- Fixed a pagination issue in the SQL Indexed Topics view
- Fixed several instances where the CLI would not report the expected state change (Updated vs. Not Changed) on apply
