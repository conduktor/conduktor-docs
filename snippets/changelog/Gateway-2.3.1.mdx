title: Gateway 2.3.1
---

*Release date: 2023-12-21*

### Enhancements

#### Gateway mode

You can now choose to setup your gateway in one of the following mode

* `KAFKA_SECURITY` where your credentials and ACL handled your target Kafka cluster
* `GATEWAY_SECURITY` where your credentials and ACL handled by Gateway
* `VCLUSTER` where your virtual clusters, credentials and ACL handled by Gateway

Previous `GATEWAY_FEATURE_FLAGS_SINGLE_TENANT` and `GATEWAY_FEATURE_FLAGS_MULTI_TENANCY` are migrated automatically.

#### ACL fixes

Few ACL ordering/conflict patterns are now resolved. 
We are now following [KIP679](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-679%3A+Producer+will+enable+the+strongest+delivery+guarantee+by+default)

#### Better error management

Upon duplicate UserMapping creation we are now returning a `STATUS_CODE_CONFLICT` error code (or 409).

#### Gateway and Broker config

Gateway properties are now visible in the broker properties page
