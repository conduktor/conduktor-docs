### Features
- Added support for Azure Managed Identity for Kafka authentication
- Implement OIDC logout. You may need to update your OIDC configuration to allow the root page of Console as a possible redirect URI

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue with OIDC login that could cause an expired sessions to become stuck and prevent login in again.
