title: Conduktor 1.15.0
---


Conduktor version 1.15.0 is now available, introducing various new features and optimizations. This release brings an enhanced Audit experience to Enterprise customers, data export functionality into Console, and organization-wide tagging of resources. See the full list of changes and release notes below.

### Important changes

- Note that in 1.15.0, the Testing application will no longer be started by default in the on-premise deployment. This provides a performance optimization for those customers that are not currently using Testing. If you wish to start Testing alongside Conduktor, you should set an explicit environment variable.

### Features

Give us feedback [here](https://conduktor.io/roadmap)

- **Admin**

  - Audit Log has been completely revamped and enriched. Events now contain relevant contextual information (upon click), and logs can now be filtered by a range of criteria (user, resource type, resource name, event, cluster and date).

- **Console**
  - Tags are now organization-wide, meaning visibility of this additional metadata is shared amongst colleagues in your organization.
  - You can now export data in either CSV or JSON format via the Consumer view. 
  - When using multiple JS filters in the Consumer view, these are now combined with logical AND instead of OR.
  - New experience for showing statistics on each resource that enables more of the screen to be used for displaying data.
  - Cluster selection RBAC: Visibility of clusters that can be selected now depends on the users data permissions applied through RBAC.
- **Testing**

  - Testing is now disabled by default when starting Conduktor. To start Testing alongside Conduktor, you should set an explicit environment variable.
  - Note that in Conduktor 1.15.0, the Testing application will no longer be started by default on our on-premise deployment. It's still available on our Cloud version.
  - 
If you wish to start Testing alongside the Platform on-premise, you must start Conduktor using an explicit environment variable.

**How to start Console with Testing?**

Set the environment variable `TESTING_ENABLED` to **true** when starting Conduktor.

**Why are we making this change?**

By removing the number of services started by default on-premise, this provides a performance optimization for customers that are not currently using Testing.

- **Monitoring**

  - All monitoring metrics are now provided without any agent dependencies

### Fix 🔨

- **Platform**

  - CVEs fixes

- **Console**

  - Support negative lag in consumer groups (cases whereby the last committed offset is greater than the latest offset)
  - Security fix to stop exposing cluster configuration inside the UI.

- **Monitoring**

  - Computation of URP metric is set to 0 if we find `confluent.log.placement.constraints` in the cluster config or `confluent.placement.constraints` in the topic config. This avoids raising a false positive alert in case of a multi-region Confluent cluster. Note this logic will also be applied in Console in the next release.

- **Governance**

  - Do not show error toast in Data Masking when a user/group no longer exists in a policy.

- **Admin**

  - Accept "/" character in consumer group name
