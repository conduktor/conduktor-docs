### Important changes

- This version replaces `platform.fqdn` configuration with `platform.external.url` (used for SSO callback URL when using a reverse proxy).

### Features

Give us feedback [here](https://conduktor.io/roadmap)

- **Platform**

  - External group mapping for LDAP/OIDC - [See docs](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/user-authentication/external-group-sync/)
  - DB support for TLS - [See docs](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/database/#ssl-support)
  - Allow to force platform URL with `platform.external.url` configuration. This can fix SSO callback URL errors if upstream proxy sends the wrong `X-Forwarded-*` HTTP headers to the platform.

- **Console**

  - Support mTLS on Kafka Connect
  - Improve the performance of the consumer and topic lists screen
  - New design for the cluster dropdown has been implemented

- **Admin**
