### New features

#### `GATEWAY_SECURITY_MODE` environment variable

This release introduces the `GATEWAY_SECURITY_MODE` environment variable,
which simplifies the security configuration by splitting out **what** manages authentication/authorization (valid values: `KAFKA_MANAGED` or `GATEWAY_MANAGED`) from **how** it should be managed (still set in the `GATEWAY_SECURITY_PROTOCOL` environment variable).

This change:

- deprecates the `DELEGATED_SASL_PLAINTEXT` and `DELEGATED_SASL_SSL` security protocols (though they remain supported for backward compatibility)
- enables ACLs by default when managing security on the Gateway, by changing the default behaviour of the `GATEWAY_ACL_ENABLED` environment variable. ACL behavior is now derived from the security mode
- is backwards compatible, supporting existing configurations while encouraging the new approach
