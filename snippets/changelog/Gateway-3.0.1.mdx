# Gateway 3.0.1

### General fixes

- Fixed some issues with Encryption when the value is a tombstone.
- Fixed some inconsistencies between the OpenAPI Spec and the actual implementation.
- Fixed a memory leak when using the default `GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_CONNECTION_POOL_TYPE`.
- Added a startup check to prevent an incompatible configuration: `GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_CONNECTION_POOL_TYPE=ROUND_ROBIN` with delegated authentication.
