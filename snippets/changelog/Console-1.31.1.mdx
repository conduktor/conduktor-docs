# Hotfix for Console 1.31.0


### Console metrics performance and configuration

To address issues related to monitoring graph timeouts and OutOfMemory issues when Console is connected with large Kafka clusters, we've introduced a change to how metrics are collected in Console.

This feature is currently optional but will be enabled by default in the next release.

If you're experiencing graph timeouts or OutOfMemory issues, upgrade to 1.31.1 and configure the following additional environment variables:

```
CDK_MONITORING_ENABLENONAGGREGATEDMETRICS: false
CDK_MONITORING_USEAGGREGATEDMETRICS: true
```

This configuration will disable the collection of obsolete granular metrics and use the new aggregated metrics in the Console graphs.
