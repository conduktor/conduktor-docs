title: Console 1.22.0
---


### Future Breaking Changes

#### New Docker image name

We have renamed the Console docker image to `conduktor/conduktor-console` to clarify our product naming.

We will publish newer versions using both names for the next **two releases** only. Please modify your installation to reflect this change in advance of us deprecating the name `conduktor-platform`.

```shell
docker pull conduktor/conduktor-console:1.22.0
```

#### Topic as a Service becomes Self-service

Self-service is a replacement for Topic as a Service. It is more centered towards a GitOps way of working, though we have performed a migration for existing TaaS applications to ensure a seamless transition to the new model:

- Applications + Environments are migrated to `Application` and `ApplicationInstance`
- Cross Application accesses are migrated to `ApplicationInstancePermission`
- The Application list becomes Application Catalog
- At the moment, we decided that we should control everything from the CLI only. The UI will remain Read-Only for now, but the intention is to bring back UI-driven operations in a future release.

[Read More about Self-service](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/navigation/self-serve/)

To start using Self-service, you must download our Conduktor CLI which lets you deploy resource files in Console.

#### Conduktor CLI

Console now has a CLI! [Get Started](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/reference/cli-reference/) with it today.

For now, we only support the following resources:

- Application
- ApplicationInstance
- ApplicationInstancePermission

Our objective is to let Application Teams and Central Teams manage both Console resources (Clusters, Groups, Permission, Self-service resources, DataPolicies, Alerts, ...) and Kafka resources (Topics, Subjects, Connectors, ...) using a common definition mechanism.

More to come, automate everything!

```yaml
---
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "ApplicationInstance"
metadata:
  application: "clickstream-app"
  name: "clickstream-app-dev"
spec:
  cluster: "shadow-it"
  service-account: "sa-clickstream-dev"
  resources:
    - type: TOPIC
      name: "click."
      patternType: PREFIXED
    - type: GROUP
      name: "click."
      patternType: PREFIXED
```

#### Custom Deserializers

Console's support for Custom Deserializers is finally here:

[Check out the guide to installing and configuring custom deserializers](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/guides/custom-deserializers/).

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue with controller metrics in Monitoring when the Kafka cluster is using KRaft
- Added support for Broker, Connect, and ksqlDB `id` field and TLS authentication in the YAML configuration file and Environment variables. This implies you might have a duplicate Connect instance if you use a YAML file with an ID for your Connect cluster. Check the [Environment Variables](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/env-variables/#kafka-connect-properties) page for more details
- Added new [configurations](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/env-variables/#indexing) to tune indexing batching and parallelization.s
- Fixed an issue with Azure PostgreSQL preventing the Schema Registry page from displaying properly
