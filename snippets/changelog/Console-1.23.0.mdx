# Console 1.23.0

### Future Breaking Changes

#### New Docker image name

We have renamed the Console docker image to `conduktor/conduktor-console` to clarify our product naming.

We will publish newer versions using both names for this release and the **next release** only. Please modify your installation to reflect this change in advance of us deprecating the name `conduktor-platform`.

```shell
docker pull conduktor/conduktor-console:1.23.0
```

#### Self-service

There's a host of new functionality available providing our first truly powerful self-service release. This comes from the addition of two new resources (Topic, TopicPolicy), application tokens, a topic catalog and service account synchronization.

Application Teams can now manage their Topic resource lifecycle through IaC with the addition of the [Topic](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/reference/resource-reference/kafka/#topic) object, and they can do this safely with Platform Teams putting in place a [Topic Policy](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/reference/resource-reference/self-service/#topic-policy) to restrict expensive configurations and enforce naming standards.

Checkout the definitions below and find the full list of resource definitions via the [Resource Reference](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/reference/resource-reference/) documentation.

#### Topic

This creates a Topic in the defined cluster.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v2
kind: Topic
metadata:
  cluster: shadow-it
  name: click.event-stream.avro
spec:
  replicationFactor: 3
  partitions: 3
  configs:
    min.insync.replicas: '2'
    cleanup.policy: delete
    retention.ms: '60000'
```

#### TopicPolicy

TopicPolicy lets Platform Team define governance rules to restrict Application Teams to create Topics with misconfigurations.
This is also useful to enforce naming convention or metadata annotation by Application Teams.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "TopicPolicy"
metadata:
  name: "click-naming-rule"
spec:
  policies:
    metadata.name:
      constraint: Match
      pattern: ^click\.(?<event>[a-z0-9-]+)\.(avro|json)$
    spec.replication.factor:
      constraint: OneOf
      values: ["3"]
    spec.configs.retention.ms:
      constraint: Range
      max: 604800000  # 7d
      min: 3600000    # 1h
```

#### Topic Catalog

We've introduced the Topic Catalog, to help teams discover Kafka Topics within your organization. Quickly get visibility on ownership and business metadata on your choice for topics.

Add topics to applications to see them appear within the catalog across all your clusters, searchable by name and labels.

#### Application API Keys

Generate ApplicationInstance API Keys to create any ApplicationInstance scoped resources.
Only ApplicationInstancePermission and Topic are supported at the moment.

Use this Key with the CLI to use it manually or within CI/CD pipelines.

In addition, Service Account's ACLs are now synchronized with the permissions from ApplicationInstance and ApplicationInstancePermission resources.

#### Editable columns on the Consume Page

You can now customize the columns you want to display in the Consume Page. Let us know if there's any additional metadata you want to see!

#### Quality of Life improvements

**Topic pages**

- SchemaId is now displayed from the Message Viewer panel
- Header count is now displayed from the Message Viewer panel
- The More Options "..." button has been moved so that it's available from every Topic details tab
- Added a check to prevent producing empty keys to a compacted topic
- Added an "Add partitions" button in Partitions tab

**Schema Registry pages**

- The current schema is now inside a read-only area
- Increased the width of the side panel when creating/updating schemas
- Full height is used in the panel to show/edit the schema

**Kafka Connect pages**

- Kafka Connect List can now be sorted by the number of Tasks
- Removing a Connector now properly redirects the user to the Connector list instead of the Configuration tab of the deleted Connector
- Topics column is now sourced from more configuration keys (`kafka.topic`, `kafka.topics`, `topic`, `topics`)

**Settings**

- Permissions on KafkaConnect and ksqlDB now properly display the name instead of the UUID
- Adding Users to Groups can now be done from the User details page directly
- Added the Group name in the UI to be used in the API or CLI

**Other**
