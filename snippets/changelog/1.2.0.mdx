### Load CSVs from S3 Compatible Storage

Previously it was only possible to load a file from a location that was local to your testing Agent. This new option for loading data from S3 into a test scenario brings much more flexibility. Specifically, it unlocks a more appropriate method for loading external files in automated tests that run in your CI/CD pipeline.
