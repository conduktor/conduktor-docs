# Conduktor 1.5.1

Discover the latest version of Conduktor in 1.5.1, packed with an array of upgrades across the platform and its solutions. The Console introduces advanced features like the ability to reset offsets based on a "datetime" strategy, duplicating Consumer Groups, updating Topics configuration, and resetting Topics configuration. The Platform brings enhanced functionality with support for external S3 storage for monitoring data and custom Truststore configuration for SSL/TLS connections. Additionally, LDAP connection for SSO now offers more configuration parameters. Testing gains a structured summary in the console and AWS IAM default credential chain compliance. Monitoring allows users to select a custom date/time range and displays the number of messages per second without configuring a JMX agent. The Admin section receives improvements with enhanced cluster UI and simplified clusters configuration. Several fixes address issues across the Platform, Console, Testing, and Data Masking, ensuring a smoother user experience.

### Features

- **Platform**

  - Add support of external S3 storage for monitoring data. see [documentation](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/env-variables/#monitoring-properties)
  - Add support of custom Truststore configuration for SSL/TLS connections. see [documentation](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/env-variables/)
  - SSO : Add more configuration parameters for LDAP connection. see [documentation](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/env-variables/#ldap-properties)

- **Console**
  - Consumer Groups - Reset Offsets: New "datetime" strategy to choose when to reset the offsets to
  - Consumer Groups: You can now duplicate a Consumer Group
  - Topics configuration: You can now update your Topics configuration
  - Topics configuration: You can now reset your Topics configuration
  - IAM support: Our `io.conduktor.aws.IAMClientCallbackHandler` class used to configure IAM in the Platform now complies with the "credentials provider chain" mechanism of AWS.  
    It'll first try to find your credentials/role on your machine, as `software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMClientCallbackHandler` would do. If nothing is found, then it'll use our mechanism. For more info, see [documentation](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/configuration-snippets/#amazon-msk-with-iam-authentication-example).  
     To summarize, our `io.conduktor.aws.IAMClientCallbackHandler` class can now be used as a drop-in replacement of `software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMClientCallbackHandler` in your Kafka properties:

```yaml
properties: |
  security.protocol=SASL_SSL
  sasl.mechanism=AWS_MSK_IAM
  sasl.jaas.config=software.amazon.msk.auth.iam.IAMLoginModule required;
  sasl.client.callback.handler.class=io.conduktor.aws.IAMClientCallbackHandler
```

- **Testing**

  - Added a structured summary in console at the end of executions
  - AWS IAM : default credential chain compliance

- **Monitoring**

  - It's now possible to select a custom date/time range via the calender selection
  - Number of messages in / s is now available even without configuring a jmx agent

- **Admin**
  - The clusters UI now supports read/write/delete (cluster, schema registry, kafka connect)
  - The clusters configuration int the configuration file can be used as a 1st initialization but is not mandatory anymore to create clusters

### Fix ðŸ”¨

- **Platform**

  - Remove unused configuration fields (`auth.local-users[].groups` and `slack-token` )

- **Console**

  - Create Topic form: The replication factor was not aligned with the Cluster configuration
  - Create Topic form: Improve error handling
  - CTRL+F is now working in the data viewers
  - Consumer Group: When "Overall Lag" and/or "Members" values were 0, they were displayed as N/A
  - Sometimes, in the top-level bar of the app, your Clusters were reported as "Not connected" while they were connected
  - Sometimes, when producing Avro data, an "Invalid JSON returned. Please try again" error was incorrectly displayed, and the produced data was not correctly displayed

- **Testing**

  - Fix agent connectivity hanging when using multiple instances of an agent
  - Fix menu tooltips being displayed behind the canvas
  - Fix loader not being centered
  - Fix Text4Shell CVE from org.apache.commons.commons-text-1.9

- **Data Masking**
  - Fix the creation rule form when a lot of field are added. The "create button" stay accessible now.
