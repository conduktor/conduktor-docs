### Important change when updating to Conduktor 1.18.0 (September 14th, 2023)

#### Monitoring

We are cleaning up our Docker image to bring you a simpler, lighter, and generally more operable product.

In that regard, we have extracted the 'Storage & Alerting' aspect of the Monitoring Solution from the base Console image and moved it to a [dependency image](https://hub.docker.com/r/conduktor/conduktor-console-cortex/tags).

**Consequences**:
- If you didn't use Monitoring: No further action is required on your part. You won't be able to access the Monitoring module anymore.
- If you used Monitoring: read the [documentation](/platform/get-started/configuration/env-variables/#monitoring-properties) to understand how to deploy and configure the dependency image `conduktor/conduktor-console-cortex:1.18.0`.

#### Embedded database

As having a Postgres database is one of the production requirements we have, we decided to remove the embedded Postgres database from the Docker image. That way, having a Postgres database is now required to deploy Conduktor Console. If you want to get started and discover the product, here are guide for [Docker](/platform/get-started/installation/get-started/docker/) and [Kubernetes](/platform/get-started/installation/get-started/kubernetes/).

#### Testing

In line with the deprecation of the Testing module, we have removed Testing from the base image.

#### Authentication

Finally, we have rewritten our authentication module due to all those changes, to move to something far simpler. If you have any issues with authentication using LDAP or OIDC with this new release, please contact [Conduktor Support](https://support.conduktor.io).
