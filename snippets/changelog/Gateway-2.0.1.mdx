# Gateway 2.0.1

### General fixes 

- Improved error handling on start: When faced with issues to do with missing keystores or inadequately configured port count, we'll throw you some better error messages
- Improved robustness of memory handling during network outages
- Improved robustness for the audit log
- Improved robustness when scaling
- Renamed `GATEWAY_HOST` to `GATEWAY_ADVERTISED_HOST` : Don't worry it will still work with the old value too!
- Include token detail on expiry: When tokens expire the token detail is provided in the expiry message
