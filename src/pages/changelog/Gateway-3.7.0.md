### Breaking Changes ðŸ’£

#### Breaking change: separator for superusers 
Superusers in Gateway (specified in the `GATEWAY_SUPER_USERS` environment variable) are now separated by a semicolon `;` instead of a comma `,`. 
This change is to allow superusers identified with mTLS using their full DN form (`CN=writeuser,OU=Unknown,O=Unknown,L=Unknown,ST=Unknown,C=Unknown`), 
and makes Gateway aligned with the Kafka configuration.
Note: This change does not affect the superusers specified in virtual clusters, as they are specified using a YAML array.

### Feature changes
- Add support for AWS Glue Schema Registry
- Change `Virtual Cluster` APIs to allow `.` in the name
- Improve error reporting when validating interceptor configuration

### Bug fixes
- Add `aws-java-sdk-sts` dependency to allow assume role profiles when using AWS kms
- Add `jcl-over-slf4j` dependency to see logs from AWS SDK
