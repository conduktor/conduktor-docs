We are excited to announce the release of Conduktor 1.8.0! This version introduces a new [certificate management mechanism](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/get-started/configuration/ssl-tls-configuration/) for Kafka, Kafka Connect, and Schema Registry connections. Take advantage of the enhanced cluster configuration screens with authentication helpers in the Admin section. Additionally, this update brings numerous new events to the audit log, enabling comprehensive tracking of activities. Explore the complete list of audit events in the [documentation](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/navigation/settings/audit-log/). Other notable features include improvements to the Console, Monitoring, Topic as a Service, Testing, and Platform modules. Several bug fixes have also been implemented, resolving issues in Console, Data Masking, Monitoring, Testing, and Topic as a Service.
