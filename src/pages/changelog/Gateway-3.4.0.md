*Release date: {frontMatter.date.toISOString().slice(0, 10)}*

## Upcoming Breaking change ðŸ’£
:::info
This breaking change only impacts Local Gateway service accounts generated through our token endpoints:
- `POST /admin/username/{username}`
- `POST /admin/vclusters/v1/vcluster/{vcluster}/username/{username}`

If you are not using Local Gateway services accounts (OIDC, mTLS, Delegated Kafka), you are **not** impacted.
:::
Today, the token as the password for local Gateway service accounts contains all the necessary information. As a result, the SASL username is not used during the authentication phase.  

In an **upcoming** release, we will strictly enforce that the username and the token matches. This will help reduce inconsistencies and avoid unexpected behaviors.

**This breaking change is due for release 3.5.0.**   
For this release 3.4.0, we'll only raise the following warning in the logs:  
````
2024-08-27T18:15:29 [WARN] - Inconsistency detected for plain authentication. Username applicationA is not consistent with validated token created for application-A. SASL configuration should be changed accordingly.
````

## Features âœ¨

- [Correct Offsets on Concentrated Topics](#correct-offsets-on-concentrated-topics)

### Correct Offsets on Concentrated Topics

The main limitation of Concentrated Topics was its inability to show correct Lag and Message Count.  

This is now a problem from the past as we are now computing offsets directly within the Gateway.

This experimental feature can be enabled per ConcentrationRule.

Check the dedicated documentation for more details on the feature and its limitations.


## General fixes ðŸ”¨

- 

## Known issues
- We are aware of an issue with `kcat` when the new environment variable `GATEWAY_MIN_BROKERID` is not aligned with the first BrokerId of your Kafka cluster.
  - As a workaround, you can either define `GATEWAY_MIN_BROKERID` to your first Kafka BrokerId or use `kcat` with the `-E` flag
