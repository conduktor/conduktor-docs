*Release date: {frontMatter.date.toISOString().slice(0, 10)}*

## Upcoming Breaking change ðŸ’£
:::info
This breaking change only impacts Local Gateway service accounts generated through our token endpoints:
- `POST /admin/username/{username}`
- `POST /admin/vclusters/v1/vcluster/{vcluster}/username/{username}`

If you are using Gateway services accounts from OIDC, mTLS, Delegated Kafka, you are **not** impacted.
:::
Today, the token as the password for local Gateway service accounts contains all the necessary information. As a result, the SASL username is not used during the authentication phase.  

In release 3.5.0, we will strictly enforce that the username and the token matches. This will help reduce inconsistencies and avoid unexpected behavior.

For this release 3.4.0, we'll only raise the following warning in the logs:  
````
2024-08-27T18:15:29 [WARN] - Inconsistency detected for plain authentication. Username applicationA is not consistent with validated token created for application-A. SASL configuration should be changed accordingly.
````

## Features âœ¨

- [Correct Offsets on Concentrated Topics](#correct-offsets-on-concentrated-topics)

### Correct Offsets on Concentrated Topics

The main limitation of Concentrated Topics was its inability to show correct Lag and Message Count.  

This is now a problem from the past as we are now computing offsets directly within the Gateway.

This experimental feature can be enabled per ConcentrationRule.
````yaml
---
kind: ConcentrationRule
metadata:
  name: myapp-concentrated
spec:
  pattern: myapp-.*
  physicalTopics:
    delete: myapp-concentrated
  autoManaged: false
  trueOffsets: true
````

Check the dedicated [documentation](/gateway/concepts/logical-topics/concentrated-topics) for more details on this [feature](/gateway/concepts/logical-topics/concentrated-topics#message-count--lag-offset-incorrectness) and its limitations.


## General fixes ðŸ”¨

- Fixed an issue impacting live consumption from concentrated topics within Console
- Fixed an issue with upserts in API V2 relating to service accounts (reporting updated when the status should be not changed)
- Fixed an issue related to Kafka 3.7 client support, ensuring topic id's for alias and concentrated topics are distinct from their underlying topics


## Known issues
- We are aware of an issue with `kcat` when the new environment variable `GATEWAY_MIN_BROKERID` is not aligned with the first BrokerId of your Kafka cluster
  - As a workaround, you can either define `GATEWAY_MIN_BROKERID` to your first Kafka BrokerId or use `kcat` with the `-E` flag
