## Quality of Life improvements

### Alert list redesign
Weâ€™ve redesigned our alert lists across the product to provide a more intuitive overview of alert configurations and statuses:

- The Prometheus query column is replaced with a more friendly metric and condition row.
- Added the "Last Triggered Time" column to make filtering and finding firing alerts easier.

### RBAC screen redesign

The RBAC screen displaying resource access has been redesigned to provide a clearer distinction between inherited and user-specific permissions.
