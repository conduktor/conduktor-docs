## Quality of Life improvements

## Features âœ¨

### Delegating authentication to an identity provider
Console can now be configured to accept a JWT token from an external identity provider.
It allows you to directly use your identity provider for managing access to Console.
A common use case of this feature is to delegate authentication to your API gateway.

For the full configuration details, check out the [documentation](/platform/get-started/configuration/user-authentication/jwt-auth).

### More Audit Log CloudEvents into Kafka

We have made more events available for the Audit Log Publisher:
- Kafka.Subject.ChangeCompatibility
- Kafka.Topic.Browse
- Kafka.Topic.ProduceRecord
- Kafka.Connector.Restart
- Kafka.Connector.Pause
- Kafka.Connector.Resume
- Kafka.Connector.RestartTask
- Kafka.Connector.AutoRestartActivate
- Kafka.Connector.AutoRestartStop

A full list of all the exported audit log event types is published on the [Audit Log](/platform/navigation/settings/audit-log/#exportable-audit-log-events) page.
