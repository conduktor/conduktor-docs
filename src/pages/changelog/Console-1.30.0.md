## Features âœ¨

### RBAC support for Conduktor SQL

In a previous release, we introduced Conduktor SQL. It was restricted to Admins because it did not apply any permission model.

This new update brings full RBAC support on Conduktor SQL:
- Users & Groups can only see and query the tables for which they have an associated Topic permission in Console
- Data masking policies are applied (with limitations) 

You can now bring SQL to all users within your organization.  

For more detailed information, check out the [SQL security](/platform/guides/configure-sql.md#sql-security) section.

### Add support for multi-hosts database configuration

You can now setup Console's backing database for high availability(HA). If you have a PostgreSQL HA setup with multiple hosts, you can now configure a Console to [JDBC connection](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/use/#connection-fail-over) to the database using a list of hosts.

```yaml
CDK_DATABASE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://user:password@host1:5432,host2:5433/console_database
CDK_KAFKASQL_DATABASE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://user:password@host1:5432,host2:5433/kafka_sql_database
```
For more information, check out the [Multi-host configuration](/platform/get-started/configuration/database/#multi-host-configuration) section in the Database configuration documentation.

### Alert list redesign
Alert lists across the product now provide a more intuitive overview of alert configurations and statuses:

- Query names are now more human readable, we've replaced the Prometheus query column with a friendly metric name & the condition under which it will fire
- Fnd firing alerts easier and those that have never been triggered with the addition of a "Last Triggered Time" column

### Delegating authentication to an identity provider
Console can now be configured to accept a JWT token from an external identity provider.  
It allows you to directly use your identity provider for managing access to Console.  
A common use case of this feature is to delegate authentication to your API gateway.  

For the full configuration details, check out the [documentation](/platform/get-started/configuration/user-authentication/jwt-auth).

### More Audit Log CloudEvents into Kafka

We have made more events available for the Audit Log Publisher:
- Kafka.Subject.ChangeCompatibility
- Kafka.Topic.Browse
- Kafka.Topic.ProduceRecord
- Kafka.Topic.SqlQuery
- Kafka.Connector.Restart
- Kafka.Connector.Pause
- Kafka.Connector.Resume
- Kafka.Connector.RestartTask
- Kafka.Connector.AutoRestartActivate
- Kafka.Connector.AutoRestartStop

A full list of all the exported audit log event types is published on the [Audit Log](/platform/navigation/settings/audit-log/#exportable-audit-log-events) page.

### RBAC screen redesign

The RBAC screen displaying resource access has been redesigned to provide a clearer distinction between inherited and user-specific permissions.

### Conduktor Chargeback: Data Export

The tabular data you can see on the Chargeback page can now be exported into a CSV file to enable easier integration with existing organization cost management data.

For more detailed information, check out the [Exporting chargeback data](/platform/navigation/chargeback#exporting-chargeback-data) section in the Chargeback documentation.
