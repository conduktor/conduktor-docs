## Breaking change ðŸ’£
:::caution Warning
This breaking change only impacts local Gateway users generated through our token endpoints:
- `/admin/username/{username}`
- `/admin/vclusters/v1/vcluster/{vcluster}/username/{username}`

All other users (OIDC, mTLS, Delegated Kafka) are not impacted.
:::

Up until now, only the password was used during authentication and the username was not used.

We have changed this behavior to enforce consistency between the username in the username fi
