## Breaking Changes ðŸ’£

### Changes to Conduktor.io Labels

We have moved the `conduktor.io` labels previously available on **Connector** and **Topic** resources to new locations. 
:::caution
This change impacts you if you:
- Update the Topic Catalog description of Topic resources via CLI/API.
- Configure Connect automatic restart with the CLI/API.

You are not impacted if you perform these actions through the UI.
:::
We recognize this change breaches the API contract and have carefully considered its implications. We remain committed to minimizing breaking changes and will continue to do our best to ensure that such changes are rare and well-justified.

As we expand the number of Conduktor-related features, this change enables a cleaner separation between:
- Labels used for sorting and filtering throughout the product
- Conduktor-specific annotations used to drive behaviors on the resources

This separation reduces the risk of conflicts, simplifies resource management, and provides flexibility for future improvements.

Topic Resource
- `metadata.labels.'conduktor.io/description'` â†’ `metadata.description`
- `metadata.labels.'conduktor.io/description.editable'` â†’ `metadata.descriptionIsEditable`

Connector Resource
- `metadata.labels.'conduktor.io/auto-restart-enabled'` â†’ `metadata.autoRestart.enabled`
- `metadata.labels.'conduktor.io/auto-restart-frequency'` â†’ `metadata.autoRestart.frequency`

Their associated values have been automatically migrated under the new names.


#### Important Note for CLI Users

Applying YAML files with old `conduktor.io` labels will fail in Conduktor Console 1.29. Be sure to update your YAML files to reflect the new labels.

Example error for outdated YAML:
```
$ conduktor apply -f topic.yaml
Could not apply resource Topic/click.event-stream.avro: Invalid value for: body (Couldn't decode key. at 'metadata.labels.conduktor.io/description')
```

## Features âœ¨

***

### Conduktor Chargeback

***

### Console Homepage
The cluster homepage have been redesigned to present you with the most useful information in one single frame:
- The health of your Kafka Cluster with a few key metrics and graphs
- The state of Console Indexing modules for this Kafka Cluster
- Quick access to your most recently viewed resources
![Kafka Connect Wizard](/images/changelog/platform/v29/console-homepage.png)

### Consumer Group pages overhaul

Consumer group details page is now organized in a way that helps understand the status of your Consumer Group easier:
- Topics tab shows the Consumer Group info grouped by its subscribed Topics
- Members tab shows the Consumer Group info grouped by its active members

Both Topics and Members lists can be explored further down to individual member/topic-partition assignments.  

On top of that graphs are now directly available in the resource page for Lag and Time Lag, as well as a dedicated tab to manage Alerts

***

### Self-Service Topic Catalog visibility

You can now choose which Topics should be visible in the Topic Catalog by annotating their YAML
````yaml
---
apiVersion: kafka/v2
kind: Topic
metadata:
  cluster: shadow-it
  name: click.event-stream.avro
  catalogVisibility: PUBLIC # or PRIVATE
spec:
  ...
````

It is also possible to change the default Topic Catalog visibility of all Topics of an Application Instance directly  
Check the associated [documentation](/platform/reference/resource-reference/self-service/#application-instance)

### Self-Service New Topic Policy Allowed Keys
We have added a new constraint `AllowedKeys` to our Self-Service Topic Policy that restricts the properties that can be configured on a Topic.  
````yaml
---
# Limits the Topic spec.configs to only have retention.ms and cleanup.policy keys
apiVersion: self-service/v1
kind: TopicPolicy
metadata:
  name: "generic-dev-topic"
spec:
  policies:
    spec.configs:
      constraint: AllowedKeys
      keys:
        - retention.ms
        - cleanup.policy
````
This works in conjunction with existing constraints and ensures your Application Teams will only define properties that are allowed by the Central Team.  
Read more about our [Topic Policy constraints](/platform/reference/resource-reference/self-service/#policy-constraints)

***

### More Audit Log CloudEvents into Kafka

We have made more events available for the Audit Log Publisher:
- IAM.User.Logout
- IAM.User.Login
- Kafka.ConsumerGroup.Duplicate
- Kafka.ConsumerGroup.Delete
- Kafka.ConsumerGroup.Update ( when we reset the offset of the consumer group )

A full list of all the exported audit log event types is published on the [Audit Log](/platform/navigation/settings/audit-log/#exportable-audit-log-events) page.

## Quality of Life improvements
- Improved the performance of the Automatic deserializer
- Improved the performance of the Schema Registry indexing process
- Added support for Google Cloud Identity group claims



## Fixes ðŸ”¨
- Fixed an issue where the ManageClusters permission wasn't working properly
- Fixed an issue that prevented to create a KafkaCluster and a Topic on that newly declared KafkaCluster in a single CLI apply
- Fixed `/health/readiness` endpoint to return HTTP 503 when Postgres DB is down
- Fixed an issue where the Message Count wasn't updated to 0 when emptying a topic
- Fixed an issue where the Pause/Resume button wasn't visible when a connector was in Failed state
- Fixed an issue where the Topic creation failure reason wasn't shown in the UI anymore. 
  - This helps understand why the Topic Creation was rejected (useful for Gateway and Self-Service Topic Policies)
