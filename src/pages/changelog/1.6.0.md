Explore the new documentation site at [docs.conduktor.io](https://docs.conduktor.io/platform/configuration/user-authentication/configure-sso/#ldaps) for comprehensive information. In the Console, a new "ACL" page provides a list of all ACLs in your Cluster (read-only for now). Additional Console enhancements include the ability to add new partitions to a topic, improvements in the topics list table, and enhanced link sharing capabilities in the Monitoring solution. The Admin section introduces TLS checks for the cluster's bootstrap servers. This version also includes various fixes, addressing issues in the Platform, Console, Testing, Monitoring, and Admin sections, ensuring a smoother user experience.
