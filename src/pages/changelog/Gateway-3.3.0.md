### Changes to ACL support on Gateway
With Gateway 3.1 we removed our dedicated ACL interceptor in favor of a new environment variable `GATEWAY_ACL_STORE_ENABLED`. This variable was enabling ACLs in all scenarios, whether you used Virtual Clusters or not.

#### Changes for Gateway 3.2
With Gateway 3.2, we are adding a new environment variable `GATEWAY_ACL_ENABLED` and modifying the behavior of the existing variable `GATEWAY_ACL_STORE_ENABLED`.  

From now on, the variables works as follow:

| Environment Variable        | Description                                               | Default   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `GATEWAY_ACL_ENABLED`       | Enable ACLs on the Gateway **excluding** Virtual Clusters | `"false"` |
| `GATEWAY_ACL_STORE_ENABLED` | Enable ACLs on Virtual Clusters **only**                  | `"false"` |


#### Preview for Gateway 3.3
In the next release, we will enhance ACLs to restore and expand the full set of features available before version 3.1. This will be achieved through the introduction of a CLI and APIs, making concepts like VirtualCluster first-class citizens.

#### Enable ACLs for Gateway (excl. Virtual Clusters)
Configure both environment variables:
````shell
GATEWAY_ACL_ENABLED=true
GATEWAY_SUPER_USERS=alice,bob
````

#### Enable ACLs for Virtual Clusters
````yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway/v2
kind: VirtualCluster
metadata:
  name: "mon-app-A"
spec:
  prefix: "app-A-"
  aclsEnabled: "true" # defaults to false
  superUsers:
  - username1
  - username2
````
This will effectively render `GATEWAY_ACL_STORE_ENABLED` obsolete.


## General fixes ðŸ”¨

- Fixed an issue with Field-level Avro encryption/decryption relating to [numeric fields](https://docs.conduktor.io/gateway/interceptors/data-security/field-level-encryption/#fields):
  - When using partial decryption with Avro schema registry, any numeric values (int, long, float, double) that are not being decrypted will instead be masked with the minimum (most negative) value for the numeric type
  - This is to ensure the field is compliant with the original type in the Avro schema
- Fixed an issue with the ClientIdRequired Policy that wasn't properly overriding the ClientId
- Fixed an issue to ensure all active connections are closed, and clients transition quicker to the new cluster during [cluster switching](https://docs.conduktor.io/gateway/demos/ops/cluster-switching/)
