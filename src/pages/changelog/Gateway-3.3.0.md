## Upcoming Breaking change 💣
:::info
This breaking change only impacts Local Gateway service accounts generated through our token endpoints:
- `POST /admin/username/{username}`
- `POST /admin/vclusters/v1/vcluster/{vcluster}/username/{username}`

If you are not using Local Gateway services accounts (OIDC, mTLS, Delegated Kafka), you are **not** impacted.
:::
Today, the token as the password for local Gateway service accounts contains all the necessary information. As a result, the SASL username is not used during the authentication phase.  
In an **upcoming** release, we will strictly enforce that the username and the token matches. This will help reduce inconsistencies and avoid unexpected behaviors.

**This breaking change is due for release 3.5.0.**   
For this release 3.3.0, and next product release 3.4.0, we'll only raise the following warning in the logs:  
````
2024-08-27T18:15:29 [WARN] - Inconsistency detected for plain authentication. Username applicationA is not consistent with validated token created for application-A. SASL configuration should be changed accordingly.
````
