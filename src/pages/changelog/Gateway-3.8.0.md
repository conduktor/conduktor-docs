### Breaking changes

#### New backing topic required for Gateway

#### Deprecating V1 APIs
V1 APIs are now deprecated in favor of the V2 APIs introduced in Gateway 3.3.0 in September 2024.  
If you are using the Conduktor CLI to operate the Gateway, you are not impacted.
Check the following link to understand which APIs are deprecated: [Gateway API Doc](https://developers.conduktor.io/?product=gateway&version=3.6.1&gatewayApiVersion=v1).
**We plan to remove the V1 APIs from the Gateway in three releases time, in Gateway 3.10.0**.  
If you are using the V1 APIs, please migrate to the V2 APIs as soon as possible.  
If you need support with this migration, please [let us know](https://support.conduktor.io/hc/en-gb/requests/new?ticket_form_id=17438363566609).
