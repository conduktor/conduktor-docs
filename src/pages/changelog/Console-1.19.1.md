## Fixes ðŸ”¨

- Massive improvement over the indexing time of your cluster. This is especially notable if you have a large number of consumer groups (> 200) on your Kafka cluster.
- Fixed an issue where Gateway Interceptors could be created/deleted by all users instead of Admin group members.
- Fixed an issue where Monitoring didn't work for non-Admin group members.
- Fixed an issue that occurred when deleting a user from Console.
- Fixed a UI issue where ACLs were not editable by non-Admin group members.
- Fixed a UI issue where user could not pick the Kafka Connect cluster when creating a new Connector.
