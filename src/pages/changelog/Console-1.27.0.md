## Features ‚ú®

### Kafka Connect Configuration Wizard

We are very excited to introduce our Configuration Wizard for Kafka Connect which is taking full advantage of the Kafka Connect Validate API:
- Form is generated with structured configuration groups
- Much nicer error handling, attached to each individual field
- Embedded documentation that helps you understand which fields are required and what are their expected and default values
- Ability to toggle advanced configuration to visualize only the most important fields
- Ability to switch seamlessly between Form View and JSON View at any time.

Give it a try and let us know what you think!

### Alerts for Kafka Connect

On top of the Kafka Connect Graphs we shipped last release, we now have added the ability to create alerts on them.

### Self-service: Limited Ownership mode
To help organizations transition to Self-service more easily, we have added a new attribute on ApplicationInstance to let Platform Teams decide the level of autonomy to give to Application Teams.  
- ApplicationInstance resources configured with `ownershipMode: ALL`, which is the default, delegates all permissions related to that resource to the Application Team
- ApplicationInstance resources configured with `ownershipMode: LIMITED` delegates only a subset of the available permissions to the Application Team

This is especially useful if you already have a centralized repository and existing workflow for Topic creation. You may want to provide Self-service capabilities while still forcing your Application Teams to go through your pipeline for Topic Creation, instead of Self-service.


### Quality of Life improvements
- Self-service: External Group Mapping is now available for ApplicationGroup
- CONS-1268: The Login page now steers users towards their OIDC provider rather than User & Password login when OIDC is enabled

## Fixes üî®
- CONS-1683: Consumer group reset offset doesn't honour the user request
- CONS-1626: Deleting and recreating subject breaks indexing
- CONS-1676: Incorrect topic create default replication factor
- CONS-1659: We get an error in the UI if we create an Application Instance without any resources.
- CUS-xxx: Several fixes around Teams Integration to support Teams workflow webhooks
- CUS-398: Fixed a recent regression with Broker feature "Similar config" calculation
- CUS-377: Fixed Kafka Connect client to use HTTP Proxy JVM configuration
- CUS-368: Console doesn't override the client.id property anymore
- Switching Kafka cluster from the Topic details page now redirects to the Topic List

## Deprecation Warning: Upcoming migration from Tags to Labels üí£
With the introduction of the Self-service resource manifests, we brought customers a means to annotate all their resources with labels. Labels are more structured than the existing Conduktor tags, thereby allowing for more precise filtering capabilities, as can be seen in the Topic Catalog.

In an upcoming release, we'll perform an automatic migration from Tags to Labels.  

Tags written with the naming convention `<key>/<value>` will automatically be added as similar labels:
- `<key>: <value>`  

If there is a conflict such as; a topic containing tags with the same key, that already has the target label, or is not written with this naming convention, then they will be created as follows:
````yaml
tag-<value>: true
````

Here's an example of how tags will be migrated into labels:
````yaml
# Tags:
- format/avro
- project/supplychain
- team/delivery
- color/blue
- color/red
- wikipedia
- non-prod

# Result
labels:
  format: avro
  project: supplychain
  team: delivery
  tag-color/blue: true # Because conflict on "color"
  tag-color/red: true # Because conflict on "color"
  tag-wikipedia: true
  tag-non-prod: true
````

‚ö†Ô∏è **Conduktor can help you rename tags through Customer Support**  
Between now and the migration, we can help you rename your tags for a smooth transition to labels.  

[Contact us](https://support.conduktor.io/) as soon as possible if you would like support.


:::warning

We are aware of a critical CVE - [CVE-2024-41110](https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/2024/cve-2024-41110/) - coming from a dependency of prometheus on the `console-cortex` image. This CVE is related to prometheus docker metric scraping, which is not used by Conduktor.

Regardless, as soon as the prometheus team fix this issue, it will be patched immediately by Conduktor.
