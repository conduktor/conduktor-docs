## Deprecation Warning: Upcoming migration from Tags to Labels üí£
With the introduction of the Self-service resource manifests, we brought customers a means to annotate all their resources with labels. Labels are more structured than the existing Conduktor tags, thereby allowing for more precise filtering capabilities, as can be seen in the Topic Catalog.

In an upcoming release, we'll perform an automatic migration from Tags to Labels.  

Tags written with the naming convention `<key>/<value>` will automatically be added as similar labels:
- `<key>: <value>`  

If there is a conflict such as; a topic containing tags with the same key, that already has the target label, or is not written with this naming convention, then they will be created as follows:
````yaml
tag-<value>: true
````

Here's an example of how tags will be migrated into labels:
````yaml
# Tags:
- format/avro
- project/supplychain
- team/delivery
- color/blue
- color/red
- wikipedia
- non-prod

# Result
labels:
  format: avro
  project: supplychain
  team: delivery
  tag-color/blue: true # Because conflict on "color"
  tag-color/red: true # Because conflict on "color"
  tag-wikipedia: true
  tag-non-prod: true
````

:::warning

We are aware of a critical CVE - [CVE-2024-41110](https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/2024/cve-2024-41110/) - coming from a dependency of prometheus on the `console-cortex` image. This CVE is related to prometheus docker metric scraping, which is not used by Conduktor.

Regardless, as soon as the prometheus team fix this issue, it will be patched immediately by Conduktor.
