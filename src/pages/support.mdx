# Conduktor Version Support Policy

We support releases of our software for one calendar year after their release date (the release date being the date the version was first published to DockerHub). For the purposes of support, the specific software artefacts in scope for this policy are:

* conduktor-console
* conduktor-gateway
* conduktor-console-cortex
* conduktor-ctl
* terraform-provider-conduktor

The end of support date applies to minor versions and any maintenance versions that come after the minor version. This means that maintenance versions follow the same one year lifecycle of the minor version. For example, Conduktor Console version `1.21.x` ends support on 26<sup>th</sup> Feb 2024, and this will include ending support for its maintenance versions `1.21.1`, `1.21.2` and `1.21.3`.

The end of support date is the last day that the version is supported.

For supported versions, our support team will work with you to address issues you may have through the most appropriate means - typically, but not limited to, an upgrade to a more recent version where a fix already exists, or a maintenance patch where necessary.

### terraform-provider-conduktor

Conduktor's Terraform provider (terraform-provider-conduktor) is still in its Alpha phase we will provide support for any customers using it, however we only provide fixes to the latest version available. I.e. while we will fully support all customers using our terraform provider, we do not support patches to versions other than the latest.
