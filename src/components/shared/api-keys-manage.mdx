## Manage API keys

To use the Conduktor <GlossaryTerm>API</GlossaryTerm> or <GlossaryTerm>CLI</GlossaryTerm>, you first need to generate an API key. To see available operations, check out the [CLI reference](/guides/automate/cli) and [API reference](/guides/automate/api) guides.

You can manage API keys using <GlossaryTerm>Console</GlossaryTerm>.

### Create API keys

To generate a new **admin API key**, go to **Settings** > **API Keys**.

Click **New API Key** at the top-right. Give it a unique name and click **Generate Key**. You can then copy it and use as required.

Make sure to copy the key as it won't be accessible when this window is closed.

### Revoke API keys

To revoke a key, select it from the list and click the **trash can** icon. You'll be prompted to confirm as this can't be undone.
