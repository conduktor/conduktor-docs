    question: 'Can I use Active Directory for SSO?',

    question: 'Does Role Based Access Control (RBAC) in Console also apply to Kafka?',
    answer:
      "No, Conduktor's RBAC model is designed to manage user permissions within the Conduktor Console, specifically for interacting with Kafka resources through Conduktor's interface. However, using Conduktor's Self-service, you can create Access Control Lists (ACLs) based on applications. This allows application teams to manage their Kafka resources autonomously, ensuring that each application has the necessary permissions to interact with Kafka topics, consumer groups and other resources.
