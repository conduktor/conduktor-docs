<ProductScalePlus /> 

Chargeback allows organizations to track and allocate costs/usage associated with Kafka resources to different teams or departments based on their data consumption and processing, facilitating cost accountability and management.

Currently, the tracked metrics are: **bytes produced and consumed by service accounts**. We'll be adding more metrics soon.
