title: Monitor Partner Zone status

<Check>This feature is available with [Conduktor Exchange](https://conduktor.io/exchange) only.</Check>

Partner Zones have different statuses to help you understand what's happening with your shared data. Here's what each status means and what to do when things go wrong.

## Partner Zone statuses

Your Partner Zone will show one of these statuses:

- **Pending**: We're setting up your Partner Zone. This usually takes a few moments.
- **Ready**: Everything's working! Your partner can connect and access the topics.
- **Failed**: Something went wrong. Check the details below to fix it.
- **To Delete**: The Partner Zone is being removed.
- **Deleted**: The Partner Zone has been completely removed.

## Check your Partner Zone status

### In Console

1. Go to **Settings** > **Partner Zones**
2. Look at the status column for each Partner Zone
3. Click on a Partner Zone to see more details

The status shows as a colored badge:
- üü¢ **Ready** - working correctly
- üü° **Pending** - being set up
- üî¥ **Failed** - needs your attention

### Using CLI

Check status from the command line:

```bash
# See all Partner Zones and their status
conduktor get PartnerZone

# Check a specific Partner Zone
conduktor get PartnerZone my-partner-zone
```

You'll see output like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: v2
kind: PartnerZone
metadata:
  name: my-partner-zone
  status: READY
  updatedAt: "2025-01-27T12:55:05.387368Z"
```

## When Partner Zones fail

If your Partner Zone shows **Failed**, here's how to fix the most common problems:

### Gateway not responding

**Problem**: Status shows `Failed to connect to Gateway cluster`

**Fix this**:
1. Check your Gateway is running
2. In Console, go to **Settings** > **Clusters** 
3. Find your Gateway cluster and click the **Provider** tab
4. Make sure the Gateway API credentials are correct
5. Test the connection by clicking **Test Connection**

### Service account problems

**Problem**: Status shows `Failed to create service account`

**Fix this**:
1. Make sure your Gateway has service accounts enabled
2. Check the service account name isn't already taken
3. Verify your Gateway configuration includes:
   - `GATEWAY_SECURITY_MODE: GATEWAY_MANAGED`
   - `GATEWAY_USER_POOL_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_REQUIRED: true`

### Topic mapping issues

**Problem**: Status shows `Failed to map topic`

**Fix this**:
1. Check the backing topics exist in your Kafka cluster
2. Make sure your Gateway can access those topics
3. Verify topic names don't have special characters that Gateway can't handle

## Get help with failures

### Check Gateway logs

If you're running Gateway in Docker:
```bash
docker logs gateway-container-name | grep ERROR
```

If you're using Kubernetes:
```bash
kubectl logs deployment/gateway | grep ERROR
```

### Check Console logs

Look for Partner Zone errors in Console:
```bash
kubectl logs deployment/console | grep -i partnerzone
```

### Test Gateway connection manually

Check if Gateway is responding:
```bash
curl -u admin:conduktor http://your-gateway:8888/health
```

## Set up monitoring

### Create alerts

Stay informed when Partner Zones fail:

1. Go to **Monitoring** > **Alerts** in Console
2. Click **Create Alert**
3. Choose:
   - **Type**: Partner Zone
   - **Condition**: Status equals Failed
   - **Notification**: Email, Slack, or Teams

### Check status regularly

We recommend checking Partner Zone status:
- Daily during business hours
- After making any changes to Gateway or topics
- Before sharing credentials with new partners

### Monitor from scripts

Check all Partner Zone statuses with a simple script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for failed Partner Zones

FAILED=$(conduktor get PartnerZone -o json | jq -r '.[] | select(.metadata.status == "FAILED") | .metadata.name')

if [ -n "$FAILED" ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  These Partner Zones need attention:"
    echo "$FAILED"
else
    echo "‚úÖ All Partner Zones are healthy"
fi
```

## What to tell your partners

When Partner Zones fail, let your partners know:

- **If status is Pending**: "We're setting up your access, should be ready in a few minutes"
- **If status is Failed**: "We're fixing a connection issue, will update you shortly"
- **If you're doing maintenance**: Give them advance notice and expected downtime
