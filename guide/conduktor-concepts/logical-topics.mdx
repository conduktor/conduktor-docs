title: Logical topics

## Logical topics

Conduktor logical topics are abstractions of real Kafka topics that provide additional functionality that's not available by default. We offer three types of logical topics:

1. [Alias topics](#alias-topics) are topics that can be accessed with a name, but point to another real topic behind the scenes. They can be useful in a few scenarios such as topic renaming or cross-virtual cluster topic sharing.

1. [Concentrated topics](#concentrated-topics) allow co-locating multiple topics in the same physical topic behind the scenes. This is very useful when you want to regroup many topics with low-volume but a large number of partitions.

1. [SQL topics](#sql-topics) are using SQL language to query and filter an existing topic. This is very useful when filtering out the records that don't correspond to your business needs.

1. [Unlimited topics](#unlimited-topics) allow you to represent data from a set of topics on a single underlying topic. This means that you won't overuse your Kafka resources.

## Alias topics

Alias topics are logical topics that target a different physical topic. They act like pointers to another physical topic.

#### Purpose

One of Kafka's limitations is that you can't rename topics.

#### Use

Gateway manages an alias topic mapping in it's internal configuration by registering a target physical topic. This topic will be presented to Kafka clients like a regular topic. However, all requests for this topic will be forwarded to the physical topic.

This means that consumer groups, fetch and produce are shared. Also, the alias topic will not replace the original one.

For example, if you create an alias topic, `applicationB_orders` pointing to a physical topic `orders`, a client that's able to access the physical one would be able to see both topics.

####  Limitations

- ACLs using delegated Kafka security SASL delegated security protocols aren't supported.
- Alias topics can't reference another alias topic.

## Concentrated topics

Concentrated topics transparently act as pointers to a single physical topic on your Kafka cluster. They allow you to reduce costs on low-volume topics by co-locating messages.  

They are completely transparent to consumers and producers and allow you to emulate different partition counts irrespective of the backing physical topic's partition count.

####  Use

To create concentrated topics, first deploy `ConcentrationRule`:

````yaml
---
kind: ConcentrationRule
metadata:
  name: concentration1
spec:
  pattern: concentrated.*
  physicalTopics:
    delete: physical.topic
````

Then topics that match the *ConcentrationRule* `spec.pattern`:

````bash
kafka-topics \
  --bootstrap-server conduktor-gateway:6969 \
  --topic concentrated.topicA \
  --partitions 3

kafka-topics \
  --bootstrap-server conduktor-gateway:6969 \
  --topic concentrated.topicB \
  --partitions 4
````

![Topic Concentration](/images/concentrated-topic.png)

We now have two concentrated topics (`concentrated.topicA` and `concentrated.topicB`) with partition counts of 3 and 4 respectively, mapped to a single physical topic (`physical.topic`) with three partitions.

To ensure that consumers don't consume messages from other partitions or from other concentrated topics, we store the concentrated partition and the concentrated topic name in the record headers. Gateway will automatically filter the messages that should be returned to the consumer.

####  Limitations

##### Compact and delete+compact topics

You can create concentrated topics with any *cleanup.policy*, but your `ConcentrationRule` has to have a backing topic for each of them, otherwise it won't let you create the topic.

````yaml
---
kind: ConcentrationRule
metadata:
  name: concentration1
spec:
  pattern: concentrated.*
  physicalTopics:
    delete: physical.topic-delete
    compact: physical.topic-compact
    # deleteCompact: physical.topic-deletecompact
````

In this example, since the config for `spec.deleteCompact` is commented out, trying to create this topic will fail:

````bash
kafka-topics --create 
    --bootstrap-server conduktor-gateway:6969 \
    --topic <your-topic-name> \
    --partitions 3 \
    --config cleanup.policy=compact,delete
Error while executing topic command : Cleanup Policy is invalid
````

Backing topic cleanup policies are checked when you deploy a new `ConcentrationRule`. This prevents you from declaring a backing topic with a *cleanup.policy* of delete on the *ConcentrationRule* `spec.physicalTopic.compact` field.

##### Restricted topic configurations

The following list of topic properties are the only allowed properties for concentrated topics:

- `partitions`
- `cleanup.policy`
- `retention.ms`
- `retention.bytes`
- `delete.retention.ms`

If any other configuration than the above is set, the topic creation will fail with an error.

`retention.ms` and `retention.bytes` can be set to values lower or equal to the backing topic. If a user tries to create a topic with a higher value, topic creation will fail with an error:

```
kafka-topics --create 
    --bootstrap-server conduktor-gateway:6969 \
    --topic <your-topic-name> \
    --partitions 3 \
    --config retention.ms=704800000
Error while executing topic command : Value '704800000' for configuration 'retention.ms' is incompatible with physical topic value '604800000'.
```

This behavior can be altered with the flag `spec.autoManaged`.

<Warning>
With concentrated topics, the enforced retention policy is the physical topic's retention policy, and not the policy requested at the concentrated topic creation time. The `retention.ms` and `retention.bytes` are not cleanup but retention guarantees.
</Warning>

#### Auto-managed backing topics

When `autoManaged` is enabled:

- backing topics are automatically created with the default cluster configuration and partition count.
- concentrated topics created with higher `retention.ms` and `retention.bytes` are allowed. This automatically extends the configuration of the backing topic.

````yaml
---
kind: ConcentrationRule
metadata:
  name: concentration1
spec:
  pattern: concentrated.*
  physicalTopics:
    delete: physical.topic
  autoManaged: true
````

Let's check the backing topic retention on the physical cluster:

````bash
kafka-configs --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \
    --entity-type topics --entity-name physical.topic \
    --describe
Configs for topic 'physical.topic' are:
  cleanup.policy=delete
  retention.ms=604800000
  retention.bytes=-1
````

Let's try to create a concentrated topic with a higher retention on Gateway:

````bash
kafka-topics --create 
    --bootstrap-server conduktor-gateway:6969 \
    --topic <your-topic-name> \
    --partitions 3 \
    --config retention.ms=704800000
````

Let's review the backing topic again:

````bash
kafka-configs --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \
    --entity-type topics --entity-name physical.topic \
    --describe
Configs for topic 'physical.topic' are:
  cleanup.policy=delete
  retention.ms=704800000
  retention.bytes=-1
````

As we can see, the retention has been updated.

<Warning>
If one user requests a topic with infinite retention (`retention.ms = -1`), **all the topics** with the same cleanup policy associated with the rule **will also inherit** this extended configuration and have infinite retention.
</Warning>

#### Message count, lag and offset (in)correctness

By default, concentrated topic reports the offsets of their backing topics. This impacts the calculations of **Lag** and **Message Count** that relies on partition **EndOffset** and group **CommitedOffset**.

![Offset Incorrectness](/inages/offset-correct.png)

Any tooling will currently display the message count, and the lag relative to the `EndOffset` of the physical topic. This can create confusion for customers and applications that will see incorrect metrics.

To counter this, we've implemented a dedicated offset management capability for `ConcentrationRules`. To enable virtual offsets, add the following line to the `ConcentrationRule`:

````yaml
---
kind: ConcentrationRule
metadata:
  name: concentration1
spec:
  pattern: concentrated.*
  physicalTopics:
    delete: physical.topic
  offsetCorrectness: true
````

Note that:

- `spec.offsetCorrectness` only applies to concentrated topics with the `cleanup.policy=delete`
- `spec.offsetCorrectness` is not retroactive on previously created Concentrated Topics

#### Known issues and limitations with offset correctness

##### Performance

On startup, Gateway has to read the concentrated topic entirely before it's available to consumers. The end-to-end latency is increased by up to 500 ms (or `fetch.max.wait.ms`, if non-default).

##### Memory impact

Gateway consumes about ~250MB of heap memory per million records it's read in concentrated topics. This value is not bound, so we don't recommend offset correctness on high-volume topics, and recommend to size your JVM accordingly.

##### Unsupported Kafka API

- `DeleteRecords` is not supported
- Transactions are not supported
- Only `IsolationLevel.READ_UNCOMMITTED` is supported (using `IsolationLevel.READ_COMMITTED` is undefined behavior)
- Partition truncation (upon `unclean.leader.election=true`) may not be detected by consumers

##### Very slow consumer group edge case

<Warning>
Do not enable offset correctness when your topic has extended periods of inactivity.
</Warning>

When using topic concentration with `offsetCorrectness` enabled, there's currently a limitation for consumer groups where the data in the topics is slow moving, and/or the consumer groups are not committing their offsets frequently.

If a consumer group with a committed offset waits for the backing physical topic longer than the retention time (without committing a new offset), there's a possibility for that consumer group to become blocked.

In this scenario, a consumer group whose last committed offset has been removed from the topic, the group becomes blocked only if Gateway restarted before the next offset commit. If this limitation happens, the offsets for the affected consumer group will need to be manually reset for it to continue.

## SQL topics

Conduktor Gateway's SQL topic feature uses a SQL-like language to filter and project messages, based on a simple SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT
    type,
    price as amount,
    color,
    CASE
        WHEN color = 'red' AND price > 1000 THEN 'Exceptional'
        WHEN price > 8000 THEN 'Luxury'
        ELSE 'Regular'
    END as quality,
    record.offset as record_offset,
    record.partition as record_partition
  FROM cars
```

This supports `FetchResponse` only (i.e., resulting topic is read-only):

`SELECT [list of fields] FROM [topic name] WHERE [field filter criteria]`

<Note> 
Topic names with dash `-` characters have to be double quoted, as the dash is not a valid character for a SQL name. For example, if you have a topic `our-orders`, use `SELECT * FROM "our-orders" WHERE ...` 
</Note>

Other limitations:

- With filter records based on more than one condition, only `AND` operator is supported
- Supported predicates: `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `<>` and `REGEXP` (RegExp MySQL Operator)
- Case expression is supported
- Filtered by:
    - Record key (It supports SR):
        - Record key as string: - `.. WHERE record.key = 'some thing'`
        - Record key as schema: `.. WHERE record.key.someValue.someChildValue = 'some thing'`
    - Record value (It supports SR): `.. WHERE $.someValue.someChildValue = 'some thing'`
    - Partition: `.. WHERE record.partition = 1`
    - Timestamp: `.. WHERE record.timestamp = 98717823712`
    - Header: `.. WHERE record.header.someHeaderKey = 'some thing'`
    - Offset: `.. WHERE record.offset = 1`

#### Schemas and projections

If your data uses a schema, then it's not possible to make use of the projection feature here because the resulting data will no longer match the original schema. For plain JSON topics, you can use the `SELECT` clause to alter the shape of the data returned; however, for schema'd data (Avro and Protobuf) you must not use a projection, i.e. the select should be in the form:

`SELECT * FROM ...`

Filtering with the where clause is still supported.

If you don't supply a `basicCredentials` section for the AWS Glue schema registry, the client used to connect will attempt to find the connection information from the environment. The required credentials can be passed to Gateway in this way as part of core configuration.

## Filter topics with CEL

Conduktor Gateway's CEL topic feature uses CEL (Common Expression Language) expression to filter messages, based on a
simple CEL Expression in the form.

Currently

- Filtered by:
    - Record key (It supports SR):
        - Record key as string: - `.. record.key == 'some thing'`
        - Record key as schema: `.. record.key.someValue.someChildValue == 'some thing'`
    - Record value (It supports SR): `.. record.value.someValue.someChildValue == 'some thing'`
    - Partition: `.. record.partition == 1`
    - Timestamp: `.. record.timestamp == 98717823712`
    - Header: `.. record.header.someHeaderKey == 'some thing'`
    - Offset: `.. record.offset == 1`

#### Configuration

If you don't supply a `basicCredentials` section for the AWS Glue schema registry, the client used to connect will  attempt to find the connection information from the environment. The required credentials can be passed to Gateway in this way as part of core configuration.

Find out more about the setup for this from [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-default).

#### Example

```json
{
  "name": "myCelTopicPlugin",
  "pluginClass": "io.conduktor.gateway.interceptor.CelTopicPlugin",
  "priority": 100,
  "config": {
    "virtualTopic": "legal_user",
    "topic": "users",
    "expression": "record.value.age > 18",
    "schemaRegistryConfig": {
      "host": "http://schema-registry:8081"
    },
    "celCacheSize": 100
  }
}
```

### Schema Registry with secured template

```json
{
  "name": "myCelTopicPlugin",
  "pluginClass": "io.conduktor.gateway.interceptor.CelTopicPlugin",
  "priority": 100,
  "config": {
    "virtualTopic": "legal_user",
    "topic": "users",
    "statement": "record.value.age > 18",
    "schemaRegistryConfig": {
      "host": "http://schema-registry:8081",
      "additionalConfigs": {
        "schema.registry.url": "${SR_URL}",
        "basic.auth.credentials.source": "${SR_BASIC_AUTH_CRED_SRC}",
        "basic.auth.user.info": "${SR_BASIC_AUTH_USER_INFO}"
      }
    },
    "celCacheSize": 100
  }
}
```

## Unlimited topics

Occasionally, topics have to be created for logical, rather than technical reasons (e.g. to differentiate between business units) which can result in considerable overuse of Kafka resources.

Conduktor's topic concentration allows data from a set of topics to be represented on a single underlying topic. Clients connecting through Conduktor Gateway can use concentrated topics as usual without any additional configuration.

For example, let's say we have the following topics:

- us_east_orders - 100 partitions
- us_west_orders - 100 partitions
- emea_orders - 100 partitions
- latam_orders - 100 partitions

The total Kafka resource requirement is 400 partitions. With topic concentration, all of these topics can be concentrated to a single topic, using only 1/4 of resources:

- concentrated_orders - 100 partitions

#### Configuration

Topic concentration is configured via Gateway Enterprise Edition's admin HTTP API.

| Property name | Type | Description |
| :-- | --- | :-- |
| logicalTopicRegex | string | A regular expression to match all topic names that will be concentrated, specified as a URL parameter |
| topicName | string | The name of the underlying topic to concentrate to |

#### Example

This will match all the topics that end with *orders* and concentrate them to **concentrated_orders**.

```bash
curl
  -u "superUser:superUser"
  --request POST 'conduktor-gateway:8888/topicMappings/someTenant/.*orders'
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
  --data-raw '{
    "topicName": "concentrated_orders",
    "isConcentrated": true
  }'
```

#### Consumer offsets

When consuming from a concentrated topic, messages and ordering is always preserved but any metadata calculations (primarily lag and message count) are unlikely to be as expected. This is because the associated metadata is from the backing Kafka topic, rather than the concentrated topic seen from the perspective of the consumer. This is a known limitation.
