title: Use Self-service
---

<Check>This feature is available with [Conduktor Scale Plus](https://conduktor.io/scale) only.</Check> 

## Overview

Self-service helps you scale Kafka usage in your organization by facilitating collaboration between the **central platform team** and **application teams**.  

It simplifies and automates processes, establishes clear rules and ways of working, and standardizes the creation and management of Kafka resources.  

This approach brings governance into your enterprise through concepts like ownership and applications, delegating operations to the Application Teams rather than the Central Platform Team.

## Benefits for Central Platform team

- Define the general rules of the game
- Enforce naming conventions
- Safeguard from invalid or expensive configurations (wrong replication factor, high partition number, ...)
- Declare the Applications and their rights

## Benefits for Applications teams

- Autonomy and responsibility over their resources
- Isolation with Application namespaces
- Collaboration through permission delegation without any help from the central platform team
- Discoverability through Topic Catalog

## Concepts

Self-service relies on a central concept, the **Application**, which dictates **ownership** of Kafka resources.

Below outlines the relationships between Self-service resources.

## Central platform team resources

### Application

An application represents a streaming app or data pipeline that is responsible for producing, consuming or processing data from Kafka. Applications give business context to Kafka resources (topics, consumer groups and subjects) that directly relate to the functioning of that application or pipeline.

**Example**

```yaml
---
apiVersion: "self-service/v1"
kind: "Application"
metadata:
  name: "clickstream-app"
spec:
  title: "Clickstream App"
  description: "Clickstream records userâ€™s clicks through their journey on our website"
  owner: "clickstream-group"            # technical-id of the Console Group
```

### Application instance

**Applications** are generally deployed to one or more Kafka clusters, typically to align with the organization's development cycle or environments. We call this concept the **Application instance**.

Each Application Instance:

- Is linked to a Kafka Cluster and a Service Account
- Has ownership on the Kafka resources (topics, consumer groups, subjects, ...)
- Grants the permissions
  - On the Service Account using Kafka ACLs (`Read and Write` on Topics, `Read` on ConsumerGroups)
  - On the Application owner group in Conduktor Console using RBAC (`Admin` permissions)

**Example**

```yaml
# Application Instance (dev environment)
---
apiVersion: "self-service/v1"
kind: "ApplicationInstance"
metadata:
  application: "clickstream-app"
  name: "clickstream-app-dev"
spec:
  cluster: "shadow-it"
  serviceAccount: "sa-clickstream-dev"
  resources:
    - type: TOPIC
      name: "click."
      patternType: PREFIXED
    - type: CONSUMER_GROUP
      name: "click."
      patternType: PREFIXED
```

### Application instance policies

Application Instance Policies restrict the Application Teams to create their resources following certain rules. These rules can be related to Kafka configs but can also apply to metadata. This is what lets Platform Administrators provide a Self-service experience that doesn't look like the Wild West.

**Example**

```yaml
# Policies that restrict the Application to a certain range of configurations
# on topic configs, but also on topic metadata
---
apiVersion: "self-service/v1"
kind: "TopicPolicy"
metadata:
  name: "generic-dev-topic"
spec:
  policies:
    metadata.labels.data-criticality:
      constraint: OneOf
      values: ["C0", "C1", "C2"]
    spec.configs.retention.ms:
      constraint: "Range"
      max: 42
      min: 3
```

## Application team resources

Once an Application and Application Instance are defined, Application Teams can now organize and structure their application as they see fit. There are two groups of resources where Application Teams are given autonomy:

- **Kafka-related** resources, `Topic`, `Subject`, `Connector`, `ApplicationInstancePermission`.
- **Console-related** resources, in particular `ApplicationGroup`, allowing them to define internally who can do what within their Team.

### Kafka resources

This is how Application Teams can create the Kafka resources they need for their applications.

```yaml
# Topic example
---
apiVersion: kafka/v2
kind: "Topic"
metadata:
  cluster: "shadow-it"
  name: "click.screen-events"
spec:
  replicationFactor: 3
  partitions: 6
  configs:
    min.insync.replicas: "2"
    cleanup.policy: "delete"
    retention.ms: "60000"

```

### Application instance permissions

Application Instance Permissions lets teams to collaborate with each others.
Deploying this object will grant permission to the `grantedTo` Application Instance:

- To its Service Account (Kafka ACL)
- To the Application Team members in Conduktor Console

**Example**

```yaml
# Read permission granted to the Heatmap Application on click.screen-events topic
---
apiVersion: self-service/v1
kind: "ApplicationInstancePermission"
metadata:
  application: "clickstream-app"
  appInstance: "clickstream-app-dev"
  name: "clickstream-app-dev-to-heatmap"
spec:
  resource:
    type: TOPIC
    name: "click.screen-events"
    patternType: LITERAL
  permission: READ
  grantedTo: heatmap-app-dev
```

### Application group

Create an Application Group to directly reflect how your Application operates. You can create as many Application Groups as required to restrict or represent the different teams that use Console on your Application. For example, e.g:

- Support Team with only Read Access in Production
- DevOps Team with extended access across all environments
- Developers with higher permissions in Dev

**Example**

```yaml
# Permissions granted to Console users in the group, CP-COMPANY-CLICKSTREAM-SUPPORT, for the clickstream-app Application
---
apiVersion: self-service/v1
kind: "ApplicationGroup"
metadata:
  application: "clickstream-app"
  name: "clickstream-support"
spec:
  displayName: Support Clickstream
  description: |
    Members of the Support Group are allowed:
      Read access on all the resources
      Can restart owned connectors
      Can reset offsets
  permissions:
    - appInstance: clickstream-app-dev
      resourceType: TOPIC
      resourcePatternType: "LITERAL"
      resourcePattern: "*" # All owned and subscribed topics
      permissions: ["topicViewConfig", "topicConsume"]
    - appInstance: clickstream-app-dev
      resourceType: CONSUMER_GROUP
      resourcePatternType: "LITERAL"
      resourcePattern: "*" # All owned consumer groups
      permissions: ["consumerGroupCreate", "consumerGroupReset", "consumerGroupDelete", "consumerGroupView"]
    - appInstance: clickstream-app-dev
      resourceType: CONNECTOR
      resourcePatternType: "LITERAL"
      resourcePattern: "*" # All owned connectors
      permissions: ["kafkaConnectorViewConfig", "kafkaConnectorStatus", "kafkaConnectPauseResume", "kafkaConnectRestart"]
  members:
    - user1@company.org
    - user2@company.org
  externalGroups:
    - GP-COMPANY-CLICKSTREAM-SUPPORT

```

### Resource labels

Labels are key value pairs with no constraints to help you organize and surface business metadata into Console. It is our objective that all resources that can be created using the Conduktor CLI can be annotated with metadata in the form of labels. We have label support for a subset of our resources:

- KafkaCluster
- KafkaConnectCluster
- Topic
- Subject
- Connector

We plan to bring label support to the following resources in the future:

- KsqlDBCluster
- User
- Group
- TopicPolicy
- Application
- ApplicationInstance
- ApplicationInstancePermission
- ApplicationGroup

**Example**

```yaml
# Topic annotated with useful metadata
---
apiVersion: kafka/v2
kind: "Topic"
metadata:
  cluster: "shadow-it"
  name: clickstream.events
  labels:
    description: "A description for what kind of data this topic contains."
    business-data-classification: C2
    business-doc-url: "https://confluence.company.org/display/CLICK/Kafka"
    application-code: CLK
    environment-code: dev
spec:
  replicationFactor: 3
  partitions: 6
  configs:
    min.insync.replicas: "2"
    cleanup.policy: "delete"
    retention.ms: "60000"
```

## Limited ownership mode

To help organizations transition to Self-service more easily, we have added a new attribute on ApplicationInstance to let Platform Teams decide the level of autonomy to give to Application Teams.

- ApplicationInstance resources configured with `ownershipMode: ALL`, which is the default, delegates all permissions related to that resource to the Application Team.  
- ApplicationInstance resources configured with `ownershipMode: LIMITED` delegates only a subset of the available permissions to the Application Team.  

This is especially useful if Central Team have a centralized repository and existing workflow for Topic (or other resource) creation and wants to still own that part of the process.  

This way they can provide Self-service capabilities while still having Application Teams to go through their pipeline for Topic Creation, instead of Self-service.

| Restricted permissions in LIMITED | Description                                            |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

| `kafkaConnectorCreate`            | Permission to create new connectors.                   |

## Self-service UI

Self-service currently relies principally on the Conduktor CLI.

The Console UI reconciles actions executed via the CLI to present read-only views of your **Application Catalog** and **Topic Catalog** pages in Console. This promotes discoverability of Kafka resources with business context inside your organization.

![Application](/images/application-ui.png)


<Note>
Self-service UI is almost entirely Read-only for now. Use the CLI to interact with the product.
</Note>

## Topic Catalog Page

The Application Catalog lets you search through the Topics marked as public deployed in your organization.

You can filter by multiple dimensions: Application, Kafka Cluster, and also the Topic metadata.

![TopicCatalog](/images/topic-catalog.png)

## Application Catalog overview

In Console, the **Application Catalog** page lets you search through applications deployed in your organization. You can search by any available element such as owner and click on a required application to see

## Application Catalog list page

The Application Catalog lets you search through the Applications deployed in your organization. You can search by any element available in the list: Name, Description, Owner. You can click on an Application to get to its details page.

![Application Catalog](/images/app-catalog.png)

### Application details

The Application Details page summarizes all the information that relates to the Application:

- Application General information
- Application Instances and Ownership
- Subscribed topics
- Shared topics
- Application Groups

Additionally, if you belong to the owner Group of the Application, you can generate Application Instance API Keys to use with the CLI to create resources.

![App details](/images/app-details.png)

### Application groups

To see a list of Application Groups that belong to an Application, click on the **Groups** tab.

![Application Groups](/images/app-groups.png)

From there, if you want to see the full details of a Group, click on the table row for the Group. This will open a side panel with the Group details in the same YAML format that you can also retrieve via the CLI.
