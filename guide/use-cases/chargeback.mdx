<Check>This feature is available with [Conduktor Scale Plus](https://conduktor.io/scale) only.</Check> 

## Overview

Chargeback lets you visualize the cost allocation of service accounts on a few key metrics. Chargeback data can be viewed from the perspective of Overall Cost, Ingress or Egress. Cost is user configured $ per byte.

- **Overall Cost** displays the total dollar cost by adding together the Ingress and Egress costs
- **Ingress** shows the produced data per service account, by cost, percentage or bytes
- **Egress** shows the consumed data per service account, by cost, percentage or bytes

The measured period can be changed from 7D, 30D, 6M, 12M or YTD (Year To Date).

You can change the currency (from Dollars to GBP) of the cost of produced/consumed bytes per GB. This allows you to align the Chargeback model with your specific infrastructure costs.

## Export Chargeback data

To facilitate external analysis and reporting, the data shown in the table can be exported as a CSV file.

To export the data, click  **Export all** at the top right of the graph.

The default exported file name will be `Chargeback_<startDate>_<endDate>_<activeTabName>.csv`.

### 1. Apply the required filters

Any filters or sorting applied to the table will be reflected in the exported data.

Only data matching your current view will be included in the CSV file.

### 2. Specify what data to export

The exported data will depend on the currently selected tab:

- the **Overall Cost** tab will export the cost values
- the **Ingress** or **Egress** tab will export the produced/consumed bytes

### 3. Select the time period

The exported data will be formatted based on the selected time period:

- **7D** or **30D** will export the relevant data split by days
- **6M**, **12M** or **YTD** will export the relevant data split by months
