<Info>Pre-requisite [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)</Info>

[Get started with Conduktor](https://www.conduktor.io/get-started) in just a few minutes.

This example builds a **complete Conduktor deployment** that consists of all Conduktor **artifacts**, Redpanda Kafka, schema registry and supporting services for data generation.

## Overview

Once deployed, you’ll have access to a fully functional Kafka stack integrated with Conduktor’s UI and backend services. This environment is ideal for trying out Conduktor’s features before deploying to a production environment.

1. The **data generation service** publishes a continuous stream of synthetic events that *simulate an e-commerce business*.
2. Conduktor **Gateway intercepts Kafka traffic** to apply real-time operational controls — including *encryption*, *decryption*, *data masking*, and *Traffic Control Policies* — without requiring changes to producers or consumers.
3. The intercepted **data flows through the Conduktor Gateway proxy and lands in a Redpanda Kafka cluster** with a *schema registry* enforcing structure and compatibility across topics.
4. Conduktor Console provides a **centralized UI-based control plane** to manage both the Redpanda Kafka cluster and Conduktor Gateway, allowing you to:
   - monitor topics, schemas, consumer groups and connectors
   - define and apply Gateway policies
   - trace message flows
   - audit activity across the entire stack

## Data policies

The data policies configured in this get-started stack are:

| **Policy**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ProducePolicyPlugin          | Ensures produced messages adhere to configuration requirements. Parameters configure **Block** acks `-1` and audit compression (GZIP, ZSTD, etc).   |
| EncryptPlugin                | Encrypts full payloads for topics matching pattern: `.*_encrypted$`. Check the `customers_encrypted` topic in the `local-kafka` cluster.            |
| DecryptPlugin                | Decrypts payloads on consume for topics matching `.*_encrypted$`. Shows plaintext in `cdk-gateway`.                                                 |
| FieldLevelDataMaskingPlugin  | Masks `profile.creditCardNumber`, `contact.email` and `contact.phone` in topics matching pattern: `^[A-Za-z]*_masked$`.                             |
| CreateTopicPolicyPlugin      | Validates topic config: partitions have to be 1–3 or creation is **Blocked**.                                                                       |

## Run Conduktor

```bash
curl -L https://releases.conduktor.io/quick-start -o docker-compose.yml && docker compose up -d --wait && echo "Conduktor started on http://localhost:8080"
