title: Conduktor artifact overview
---

Conduktor platform consists of these artifacts:

- [Gateway](#gateway): A network proxy for Apache Kafka, complete with an extensible and dynamic plugin mechanism that can be used to add technical and business logic on top of your existing Kafka deployment.
- [Console](#console): The centralized UI-based control plane for managing Kafka.
- [Cortex](#cortex): The monitoring component for Conduktor Platform that runs in the background.
- [Conduktor CLI](#conduktor-cli): Our Command Line Interface that lets you automate operations.

## Gateway

Conduktor Gateway is deployed between your client applications and existing Kafka clusters. As it's Kafka protocol compliant, there are minimal adjustments required for clients other than pointing to a new bootstrap server.

### Gateway benefits

This can be used to provide functionality that is not available in Kafka natively, such as:

- **Centrally configure encryption** at the field-level or full payload.
- **Mask sensitive data** and define access control.
- **Set granular RBAC controls**.
- **Leverage multi-tenancy**.
- **Empower development teams** with self-service governance.

Supports all Kafka providers (Confluent, AWS MSK, Redpanda, Aiven, Apache Kafka).

### How it works

Gateway acts as a Kafka-compliant middle layer between clients and Kafka clusters.

#### Authentication

Supports multiple security protocols:
- PLAINTEXT
- SSL
- SASL SSL
- mTLS

#### Interceptors

Use <Tooltip tip="Super test">Interceptors</Tooltip> to add logic like encryption or filtering. Manage through [API](https://developers.conduktor.io/?product=gateway). [More on Interceptors](/guide/conduktor-concepts/interceptors)
