## Min hardware spec

|  | Gateway | Console |
| :------ | :--- |:--- |
| RAM | 4 GB  | 3 GB |
| CPU cores | 2 | 2 |
| Disk space | N/A | 5 GB |

## Gateway requirements

Conduktor **Gateway** is provided as a [Docker image](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-gateway) and a [Helm chart](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-gateway/kubernetes).

### Minimum setup

For light usage per Gateway node:

- 2 CPU cores
- 4 GB of RAM

> Each Gateway instance should support around *20–30 MB/s* of sustained throughput with minimal latency impact.

### Recommended starting setup

For medium to high usage per Gateway node:

- 4 CPU cores
- 8 GB of RAM

> This setup supports ~40–50 MB/s throughput.
> For production, run **at least 3 Gateway instances**. Scale horizontally as needed.

### Local storage requirements

While Gateway doesn't use local storage directly, some interceptors like [large message handling](/guide/use-cases/manage-large-messages) might.

### Scaling Gateway

Gateway is designed to **scale horizontally or vertically**. It's mostly CPU-bound unless caching is enabled. Monitor metrics to scale effectively.

### Interceptor impact

Interceptors add **CPU load**. Interceptors doing heavy inspection (e.g. encryption) require:

- More CPU
- More memory (recommend **4 GB RAM per CPU**)

### Kafka requirements

- Kafka version **2.5.0 or higher** (but lower than 4.0.0)
- Gateway must connect as an **admin user** with rights to:
  - Manage topics, groups, and cluster info
  - Commit offsets

## Console requirements

Conduktor **Console** is provided as a single Docker container.

### Production requirements

For **production deployments**, ensure:

- An external [PostgreSQL (13+)](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-console/#configure-postgres-database) with backups and [high availability](#database-connection-fail-over)
- [Block storage](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-console/#monitoring-properties) (S3, GCS, Azure) for monitoring
- Proper hardware allocation (see below)
- Kafka version **2.5.0+** (less than 4.0.0)

If deploying via [Helm](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-console/kubernetes), check the install guide for detailed requirements.

### Hardware requirements

Use container CGroup limits for resource control.

#### Minimum

- 2 CPU cores
- 3 GB RAM
- 5 GB disk

#### Recommended

- 4+ CPU cores
- 4+ GB RAM
- 10+ GB disk

[Configure env variables](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-console/env-variables) or [get started with Docker](/guide/get-started).

### Memory configuration

> **Note**: `RUN_MODE` is deprecated. JVM now respects container limits (up to 80%).

```bash
-XX:+UseContainerSupport -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=80
