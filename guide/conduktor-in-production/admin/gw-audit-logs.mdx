## Gateway audit log event overview

As you and your team interact with Conduktor Gateway, audit events may be generated for various scenarios. These events are logged in the Gateway audit log internal topic (see `GATEWAY_AUDIT_LOG_TOPIC`). They can be **browsed, filtered and searched** directly within Conduktor's UI or used to create custom alerts and notifications.

## Audit authentication event structure

Here is an example of a Gateway audit log event in JSON format. This event represents a successful authentication attempt to Gateway:

```json
{
  "id": "a3b7355b-dbe6-4db4-90a8-f41e0111710e",
  "source": null,
  "type": "AUTHENTICATION",
  "authenticationPrincipal": "<principal>",
  "userName": "<username>",
  "connection": {
    "localAddress": "/<gateway-ip>:<port>",
    "remoteAddress": "/<client-ip>:<port>"
  },
  "specVersion": "0.1.0",
  "time": "2025-07-18T16:07:06.570723674Z",
  "eventData": "SUCCESS"
}
```

### Field details

**Key fields and their values:**

- `authenticationPrincipal`: The tenant name, or `null` on some authentication failures.
- `userName`: The attempted user name, or `null` on some authentication failures.
- `source`: Event source, always `null` for authentication events.
- `eventData`: Contains success/failure messages and error details.

### Authentication event data

The `eventData` field contains different messages depending on the Gateway security mode, Gateway security protocol, and the authentication outcome. The following are common examples:

**Successful Authentication:**
- `"SUCCESS"` - Authentication completed successfully

**Failed Authentication - Gateway Managed - PLAIN:**
- `"Authentication failed: credentials for user could not be verified. Cause: Invalid username or password"` - Wrong credentials provided
- `"Authentication failed: credentials for user could not be verified. Cause: Password token is valid but it is not associated with <username>"` - Valid token but incorrect username
- `"Authentication failed: credentials for user could not be verified. Cause: Token has expired. Claims: {username=<username>, vcluster=<vcluster>, exp=<timestamp>}"` - Expired authentication token
- `"Authentication failed: username not specified"` or `"Authentication failed: password not specified"` - Missing required authentication fields
- `"Authentication failed: credentials for user could not be verified. Cause: Password token is valid for username <username> but it isn't associated with an existing local user."` - No local service account defined

**Failed Authentication - Gateway Managed - OAUTHBEARER:**
- `"{"status":"invalid_token"}"` - Invalid token provided

**Failed Authentication - Kafka Managed:**
- `"SASL Authentication failed."` - Authentication failed on the underlying Kafka cluster
- `"Gateway can't detect principal from your authorization exchange. Please contact your administrator"` - Principal extraction failed on Gateway before delegating authentication to Kafka
