title: Create data policies in Console  
---

## Overview

In order to meet **compliance regulations**, Conduktor Console provides a Data Masking feature that enables you to **obfuscate personal and sensitive data** within the Console.

As a Console administrator, you can **secure and govern** such data by creating Data Masking policies, so that users can't see them.

<Info>
Data Masking **does not impact how the underlying data is stored**. The data will only be masked **within the Console**. For masking, or encrypting, the underlying Kafka data, you can use the [Conduktor Gateway](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-gateway).
</Info>

Policies will be applied when **consuming Kafka messages in the Console**, as shown below. We can see that the phone number, the IBAN, and the card number, have been masked with some *****.

Here is the list of policies applied in this case.

## Create a data masking policy

In order to create a Data Masking policy and protect your data, go to **Settings** > **Data Policies**.

![List of policies](/images/data-policies.png)

Click **New Policy** and fill in the required details:

| Policy detail                       | Description                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Policy Name                         | Unique name for identifying your policy                                                                                                               |
| Compliance                          | The compliance regulation the policy adheres to (e.g. GDPR, PCI-DSS)                                                                                  |
| Information Kind                    | The kind of information for obfuscation (e.g. PII, Financial)                                                                                         |
| Masking Rule                        | How the obfuscation should be implemented (e.g. hide-all, hide-last-3)                                                                                |
| Risk Level                          | Categorization for the risk level associated with the policy                                                                                          |
| Fields                              | List of fields that should be obfuscated. It's based on JSON, and can be a path. If you want to hide multiple fields, you can click on **Add field**. |
| Resources                           | List of resources where the policy must be applied, like clusters or topics. To add new resources, you can click on **Add resource**.                 |
| Exclude Users or Groups from policy | In case you want some users or groups to see the data, you can exclude them from the policy.                                                          |

In the case above, the policy will mask the field `credit_card`, for all the users **except people from the group "Order Owners"**, on the topic prefixed by `payment-` of the `Prod Kafka Cluster`.

## Validate a policy

Once you have created a policy, you should validate it through the Conduktor Console. 

* Navigate to a topic that contains data where your policy should be applied
* Check that the expected fields are obfuscated using the appropriate masking rule

![Example of masked data](/images/masked-data.png)

We can see that the name and the credit_card are completely hidden, as we defined in the masking rules.

<Warning>
When the message key or value can't be transformed into a JSON-like structure, the whole message won't be displayed.
</Warning>
