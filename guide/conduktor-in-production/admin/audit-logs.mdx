## Audit log event overview

As you and your team interact with Conduktor, audit events are captured that give a detailed log of actions, providing a centralized visibility of user-related and resource-related events.

<Tab title="Console">

The Console audit log **events can be browsed, filtered and searched** directly within Conduktor's UI or **exported from a Kafka topic** for any further use, such as maintaining your own audit trail in other systems.

Click on an event in the audit log to expose event-specific metadata. Here's an example of an audit event for a new connector which can include metadata such as custom tags, the cluster, connector name and its ID.

Once configured with the correct [environment variables](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-console/env-variables/#audit-log-export-properties), audit log events are also exported to a Kafka topic, allowing you to leverage the benefits of Conduktor when finding a message.

  #### Export audit log events

  You can export audit log events from a Kafka topic using the Console UI. The exportable events have more detail than the legacy events, providing additional information about the event that has taken place.

  Learn how to configure audit events for export via [configuration properties](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-console/env-variables/#audit-log-export-properties).

  The events conform to the [CloudEvents specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md), a vendor-neutral format that follows the following structure:

  ```json
  {
      "specversion" : "1.0",
      "type" : "com.github.pull_request.opened",
      "source" : "https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull",
      "subject" : "123",
      "id" : "A234-1234-1234",
      "time" : "2018-04-05T17:31:00Z",
      "comexampleextension1" : "value",
      "comexampleothervalue" : 5,
      "datacontenttype" : "text/xml",
      "data" : "<much wow=\"xml\"/>"
  }
  ```

  Here's an example of a Conduktor event:
  
  ```json
  {
    "source": "//kafka/kafkacluster/production/topic/website-orders",
    "data": {
      "eventType": "Kafka.Topic.Create",
      // Additional event specific data...
      "metadata": {
        "name": "website-orders",
        "cluster": "production"
      }
      // Additional event specific metadata...
    },
    "datacontenttype": "application/json",
    "id": "ad85122c-0041-421e-b04b-6bc2ec901e08",
    "time": "2024-10-10T07:52:07.483140Z",
    "type": "AuditLogEventType(Kafka,Topic,Create)",
    "specversion": "1.0"
  }
  ```

  Here's a list of currently available audit log event types.

<Tab title="Gateway">

The Gateway audit log events are stored in an internal topic. The topic name is configured via `GATEWAY_AUDIT_LOG_TOPIC` and the feature can be enabled/disabled using `GATEWAY_FEATURE_FLAGS_AUDIT`. These events can be **browsed, filtered and searched** directly within Conduktor's UI or used to create custom alerts and notifications.

![Gateway Audit](/images/gateway-audit-log.png)

Here is an example of a Gateway audit log event in JSON format. This event represents a successful authentication attempt to Gateway:

```json
{
  "id": "a3b7355b-dbe6-4db4-90a8-f41e0111710e",
  "source": null,
  "type": "AUTHENTICATION",
  "authenticationPrincipal": "<principal>",
  "userName": "<username>",
  "connection": {
    "localAddress": "/<gateway-ip>:<port>",
    "remoteAddress": "/<client-ip>:<port>"
  },
  "specVersion": "0.1.0",
  "time": "2025-07-18T16:07:06.570723674Z",
  "eventData": "SUCCESS"
}
```

#### Field details

**Key fields and their values:**

- `authenticationPrincipal`: The tenant name, or `null` on some authentication failures.
- `userName`: The attempted user name, or `null` on some authentication failures.
- `source`: Event source, always `null` for authentication events.
- `eventData`: Contains success/failure messages and error details.

### Connection event

The connection event tracks client connections established to the Gateway. It captures client information like remote address, helping monitor who is connecting to your Gateway.

### Authentication event

The authentication event records the authentication attempts made by clients to the Gateway. It records both successful and failed authentication attempts, providing insights into who accessed the Gateway.

#### Authentication event outcomes

The `eventData` field contains different messages depending on the Gateway security mode, Gateway security protocol, and the authentication outcome. The following are common examples:

| **Security Mode** | **SASL Mechanism** | **Outcome** | **Event Data** |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :---------- | :------------- |
| Gateway Managed | PLAIN | Success | `"SUCCESS"` |
| Gateway Managed | PLAIN | Failure | `"Authentication failed: credentials for user could not be verified. Cause: Invalid username or password"` |
| Gateway Managed | PLAIN | Failure | `"Authentication failed: credentials for user could not be verified. Cause: Password token is valid but username <username> is invalid"` |
| Gateway Managed | PLAIN | Failure | `"Authentication failed: credentials for user could not be verified. Cause: Token has expired. Claims: {username=<username>, vcluster=<vcluster>, exp=<timestamp>}"` |
| Gateway Managed | PLAIN | Failure | `"Authentication failed: username not specified"` or `"Authentication failed: password not specified"` |
| Gateway Managed | PLAIN | Failure | `"Authentication failed: credentials for user could not be verified. Cause: Password token is valid for username, but username <username> is not an existing local user."` |
| Gateway Managed | OAUTHBEARER | Failure | `"{\"status\":\"invalid_token\"}"` |
| Kafka Managed | Any | Failure | `"SASL Authentication failed."` |
| Kafka Managed | Any | Failure | `"Gateway can't detect principal from your authorization exchange. Please contact your administrator"` |

<Note>
For the Gateway Managed with OAUTHBEARER, authentication may also fail if the Kafka client is unable to fetch the token from the configured OAUTH provider. This occurs before reaching the Gateway, so no audit log event would be generated.
</Note>

### Safeguard event

The safeguard event captures policy enforcement actions by safeguard interceptors such as Data Quality Producer Policy and Traffic Control Policies Interceptors.

### API keys request event

The API keys request event is generated by interceptors that track specific Kafka operations, such as `PRODUCE`, `FETCH`, `CREATE_TOPICS`, `DELETE_TOPICS`, and `ALTER_CONFIGS`.

### REST API event

The REST API event logs calls made to the Gateway's REST endpoints.

### Interceptor event

The interceptor event records encryption/decryption error messages from cryptography interceptors.

### ACL admin event
The ACL admin event tracks Access Control List operations done via Kafka Admin API, such as `CREATE_ACLS` and `DELETE_ACLS` requests.
