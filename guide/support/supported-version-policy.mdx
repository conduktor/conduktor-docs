title: Conduktor version support policy
description: See which versions we support
keywords: ['version support', 'versioning policy']
---

We support releases of our software for one calendar year after their release date (the release date being the date the version was first published). For the purposes of support, the specific software artifacts in scope for this policy are:

- Console (also covering cortex)
- Gateway

The end of support date applies to minor versions and any maintenance versions that come after the minor version. This means that maintenance versions follow the same one year lifecycle of the minor version. For example, Conduktor Console version `1.21.x` ends support on 26<sup>th</sup> Feb 2024, and this will include ending support for its maintenance versions `1.21.1`, `1.21.2` and `1.21.3`.

The end of support date is the last day that the version is supported.

For supported versions, our support team will work with you to address issues you may have through the most appropriate means - typically, but not limited to, an upgrade to a more recent version where a fix already exists, or a maintenance patch where necessary.

# Supported versions and end of support dates

## Console

Conduktor Console covers the UI, API and the cortex monitoring.

Helm charts providing in-support versions for these artifacts are also covered by support.
