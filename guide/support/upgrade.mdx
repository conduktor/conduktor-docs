Upgrade to the latest Conduktor version.

## Release cadence

Conduktor provides a new release roughly every month. We suggest that you upgrade **no more than two versions apart** at a time. 

To get notified when a new release comes out click **Follow** from the [Conduktor Console](https://support.conduktor.io/hc/en-gb/sections/16400553827473-Conduktor-Console) and [Conduktor Gateway](https://support.conduktor.io/hc/en-gb/sections/16400521075217-Conduktor-Gateway) pages.

## Upgrade Conduktor

<Note>
Each Conduktor component follows an independent release cycle, so versioning is separate for Helm charts, Console/Gateway (the Docker image which includes the related API) and the Terraform provider.

All the components follow the semantic versioning of: `major`.`minor`.`patch`.
</Note>

To see which Console/Gateway versions are supported, check out the [Helm chart compatibility matrix](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-gateway/kubernetes#compatibility-matrix).

You can also view the [repo for Conduktor Helm charts](https://github.com/conduktor/conduktor-public-charts?tab=readme-ov-file#----official-repository-for-conduktor-helm-charts). 

In general, when upgrading Console/Gateway in a Kubernetes environment, we recommend to:

1. Back up your database, in case a roll-back is required.
2. Update your Helm repo (`helm repo update`) to get the latest charts or download the required chart version manually.
3. Run a Helm upgrade (`helm upgrade ...`).
 
This ensures that the Docker image version is compatible with the Helm chart version (which includes the improvements of the chart itself).
 
By default, this upgrade should be performed as a rolling update, minimizing disruption to your service. 

During startup, the Console will automatically apply any necessary database migrations (structure or data changes). These migrations are version-aware and tracked to support version jumps safely.
 
### Terraform compatibility 

The Terraform provider compatibility is managed at the **resource level**, not the overall provider or Console version. 

New resources may require newer Console API versions. Compatibility details are:

- in each [Terraform resource's documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/conduktor/conduktor/latest/docs/resources/console_application_instance_v1)
- as inline warnings/errors when running `terraform apply`.

## Upgrade Console in production

To upgrade to the next version:

1. Back up your database, in case a roll-back is required.
2. Pull the latest image from the Docker hub:

  ```bash
  docker pull conduktor/conduktor-console
  ```

3. Change the version of your container (either in your docker-compose, or helm chart) and deploy it again.
4. Check the logs and the UI to ensure the upgrade was successful.

## Migrate Gateway API from v1 to v2

Gateway v3.3.0 introduces API v2 to enhance user experience when interacting with Gateway resources. 

When migrating from API v1 to v2, your Gateway resources will be preserved (you can interact with old resources via the v2 API) and only minimal attention is required for two resources: **Virtual Clusters** and **Gateway service account**.

### Virtual Clusters

When migrating to v2:

- the boolean value for `aclEnabled` will be automatically derived from the previously used `GATEWAY_ACL_STORE_ENABLED` variable but
- you have to populate the `superUsers` list, as it won't be done automatically when migrating.

Sample configuration:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway/v2
kind: VirtualCluster
metadata:
  name: "mon-app-A"
spec:
  aclEnabled: true # Defaults to false
  superUsers:
  - username1
  - username2
```

### Gateway service account

When migrating to v2, **user mappings** become *GatewayServiceAccount*. Every existing user mapping is migrated to v2 as `EXTERNAL GatewayServiceAccount`.  

If you were using LOCAL users (and generating tokens) with the v1 API, you have to:

1. Declare LOCAL users in the v2 API.
2. Generate tokens.
