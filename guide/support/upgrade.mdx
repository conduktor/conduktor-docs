Upgrade to the latest Conduktor version.

## Release cadence

Conduktor provides a new release roughly every month. We suggest that upgrades are done no more than two versions apart at a time.

[Subscribe to get notified about new releases](https://support.conduktor.io/hc/en-gb/articles/20131942687889-How-to-get-notified-when-there-is-a-new-version-of-Conduktor-Console-or-Gateway).

## Console upgrade process

Conduktor is released as a Docker container. To upgrade from one release to the next (in production):

1. Make a database dump (just in case you need to roll-back).

2. Pull the latest image from Docker hub:

  ```bash
  docker pull conduktor/conduktor-console
  ```

3. Change the version of your container (either in your docker-compose, or helm chart) and deploy it again.

4. Check the logs and the UI to ensure the upgrade was successful.

## Migrate from API v1 to v2

Gateway `3.3.0` introduces API V2 to bring an enhanced user experience when interacting with Gateway resources. 

If you are migrating from API V1 to V2, your Gateway resources will be preserved (meaning, you can interact with old resources via the V2 API), and only minimal attention is required for the below resources:

#### Virtual Clusters

- The automation will derive the boolean value `aclEnabled` from the previously used `GATEWAY_ACL_STORE_ENABLED` variable.
- The migration will not populate the `superUsers` list automatically, so this must be addressed as part of your migration.

Example configuration:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway/v2
kind: VirtualCluster
metadata:
  name: "mon-app-A"
spec:
  aclEnabled: true # defaults to false
  superUsers:
  - username1
  - username2
```

#### Gateway service account

User Mappings become GatewayServiceAccount. Every existing User Mapping is migrated to V2 as EXTERNAL GatewayServiceAccount.  

If you were using Local Users (and generating tokens) with API V1, new actions are required on your part.

**Required action**: You will need to first declare LOCAL users in V2 APIs to then be able to generate tokens.
