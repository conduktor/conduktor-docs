title: Enhanced Alerting System
---

## Overview

Conduktor's enhanced alerting system provides comprehensive monitoring and notification capabilities for your Kafka infrastructure and applications. Get real-time notifications when issues occur, with team-based ownership and customizable delivery channels.

**Key Features:**
- **Team-based Alert Ownership**: Assign alerts to specific users, teams, or applications
- **Multi-channel Notifications**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, and webhook integrations
- **Event-driven Alerts**: React to consumer group state changes, topic updates, and audit events
- **Customizable Per Team**: Different notification preferences for different teams
- **Advanced Filtering**: Target specific conditions and thresholds with precision

You can integrate alerts with **Slack**, **MS Teams**, **email**, and **webhooks** to receive real-time notifications. Each team can have their own notification preferences and channels. [See how to configure integrations](#configure-integrations).

Alerts are checked **every minute** for threshold-based conditions and trigger **immediately** for event-driven scenarios.

## Create alerts

Alerts can be created for various resources including brokers, topics, consumer groups, and applications in Conduktor Console.

### Threshold-based Alerts

To create a threshold-based alert:

1. Navigate to the required resource (broker, topic, consumer group).
1. Click on the **Alerts** tab.
1. Click **Create an alert**.

In the **New Alert** pane enter the required details. Each alert has to have:

- **Unique name**: Descriptive name for easy identification
- **Metric**: Choose from available metrics (e.g. messageCount, consumerLag, diskUsage)
- **Threshold**: Operator (GreaterThan, LessThan, Equals) and value for triggering
- **Owner**: Can be a user, team, or application instance. Ownership determines edit permissions and notification routing.
    <Warning>
    If the owner of an alert is deleted, the associated alerts will also be deleted.
    </Warning>
- **Description** (optional): Explain the alert purpose and resolution steps
- **Destination**: Internal (Console) or external channels. Each alert supports **multiple external destinations per team**.

### Event-driven Alerts

Create alerts that trigger on specific Kafka events:

**Consumer Group Events:**
- Consumer group state changes (rebalancing, lag spikes)
- New consumers joining or leaving groups
- Partition assignment changes

**Topic Events:**
- Topic creation, deletion, or configuration changes
- Partition count modifications
- Topic access pattern changes

**Audit Events:**
- Security policy violations
- Configuration changes by users
- Authentication failures

To create event-driven alerts:

1. Go to **Settings > Alerts** 
2. Click **Create Event Alert**
3. Select event type and conditions
4. Configure team-specific routing rules

## Manage alerts

You can **deactivate an alert without deleting** it. Deactivated alerts won't send notifications or record history/status until reactivated.

You can also test, duplicate or delete the alert at any point.

Select the event and click the three dots in the top-right corner.

### Alert history

Each alert will keep a history of when it was triggered and the status over time. This gives you an overview of successful or failed deliveries. Alerts with the `firing` status will trigger a notification every hour.

### Alert list

Go to **Settings > Alerts** to see all the alerts, grouped by owner (teams, applications, or users). You can sort the view by name, status, destination, or owner and activate/deactivate as required. You can also customize this view to show/hide columns relevant to you.

**Team-based Management:**
- **Filter by Team**: View alerts owned by specific teams
- **Bulk Operations**: Enable/disable multiple alerts for a team
- **Ownership Transfer**: Transfer alert ownership between teams
- **Team Templates**: Create alert templates for consistent team standards

## Configure integrations

Conduktor Console can integrate with **Slack**, **MS Teams** and any system that receives webhooks.

Enabling the **Slack** integration requires creating a Slack application, installing this to your Slack workspace, inviting your app to the channel and adding the application token to Conduktor.  

After enabling the **MS Teams** integration you will need a Teams webhook URL to create alerts with this destination.

<Info>
Disabling an integration used by existing alerts will not delete the alerts, but will prevent them from sending notifications externally.
</Info>

### Slack integration

As part of configuring the Slack integration in Conduktor, you will find steps for [creating a Slack application](https://api.slack.com/apps) (a bot) using the app manifest template (provided in Conduktor). This app needs to be installed to your Slack workspace and the OAuth token added to the Conduktor integration.

Once configured you'll need to add the application to the Slack channels you wish to send alerts too. You can do this by typing `/invite` in the channel and choose the application you have just created., or through managing the app within Slack.

Channels that have not had the application invited cannot be set as destinations for alerts. You'll get a `not_in_channel` error. Once the applications is invited to the channel, you'll be able to send alerts to that Slack channel.

## Email integration

Email integration allows you to receive notifications directly to your inbox. Setting up email alerts requires configuring your SMTP server details and authentication credentials.

![email integration](/images/email-integration.png)

To set up email alerts, you have to configure:

1. **Server settings**: configure your SMTP server details to enable email delivery
   - SMTP server: enter your email server address with a port (e.g., `mail.company.com:587`)
   - TLS encryption: (recommended) enable TLS encryption for secure email transmission
   - SSL configuration: you can skip SSL checks or upload custom certificates for enhanced security

1. **Authentication**: provide credentials for authenticating with your email server
   - Sender email: the email address that will appear as the sender for all alerts (e.g., `conduktor-alerts@company.com`)
   - Username and password: your email server authentication credentials
   - Test configuration: click **Test configuration** to validate your configuration before saving changes

Once your email integration is configured, you can create email alerts with customizable destination addresses, subjects and content. You can use handlebars syntax (e.g., `{{clusterName}}`, `{{threshold}}`) to embed alert variables dynamically in the body of the email.

### Email alerts used for Teams

We directly integrate with Microsoft Teams using Workflows. If you're not allowed to use this feature, you can use the email integration to send alerts to Microsoft Teams channels.

For this, first set up the [email integration](#email-integration) and get the channel's email address. You can find this in the channel settings under **Get email address**.

![get first Teams email](/images/teams-get-email-1.png)

From there, you can select which email addresses is authorized to send emails to this channel and copy it to use in your Conduktor alert.

### Microsoft Teams integration using Workflows

This guide focusses on the Workflows integration, rather than webhooks which are used with Microsoft teams to handle alerting from Conduktor's monitoring.

You can send notifications to different rooms for different alerts. However, this room must be a Microsoft Teams *standard room* and not a *shared* room.

#### Workflows setup

1. Open the Workflows app within the chat or channel by right-clicking on the conversation or by clicking **...** then selecting **Workflows**.

![Workflow step 1](/images/workflows-1.png)

2. In the Workflow app, click **+ New flow** or select the Create tab and choose **Post to a channel when a webhook request is received** template.

![Teams workflow step 2](/images/workflows-2.png)

3. Choose a name for this flow (or use the default **Post to a channel when a webhook request is received**) and choose who will own this workflow. It should default to the user logged into Teams. Click **Next**.

![Teams workflow step 3](/images/workflows-3.png)

4. Pick the team and channel you want to post to, then click **Create flow**. This page may take some time to load.

![Teams workflow step 4](/images/workflows-4.png)

5. Once you click on **Create flow** in the previous step, the next page should show you the URL for the webhook associated with the workflow you just created. *Copy and paste this somewhere* as it will be used in a later step and click **Done**.

6. Go back to the Home tab in Workflows and edit the newly created workflow by clicking **...** then **Edit**.

![Teams workflow step 5](/images/workflows-5.png)

7. On this page:
    1. Expand **When a Teams webhook request is received** to see the URL endpoint again, if you've not saved it from the previous step. You can also change *who can trigger the flow*. In this example we'll use *Anyone*.
    1. Expand the second step and for **Select an output from previous steps**, pick **Attachments**. For **Adoptive Card** select **content**. The rest of the form should be filled in but you can change the channel and team here.

  ![Teams workflow step 6](/images/workflows-6.png)

8. Open Console and [create a new alert](#create-alerts) or go to an existing one. In the **Alert destination** page select **Teams**. Paste the webhook URL and click **Save**. You can test your connection by clicking **Send test**.

9. Fire some alerts and you should now see alert messages being posted in Microsoft Teams under the specified channel:

### Webhook integration

You can use a tool like [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to check the payload sent for webhook notifications.

Here's an example:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "metatadata": {
      "name": "high produce rate",
      "appInstance": null,
      "group": "menu-team",
      "user": null,
      "updatedAt": "2025-01-21T14:13:34.729783423Z",
      "updatedBy": "mary@example.com",
      "lastTriggeredAt": null,
      "status": "Pending"
    },
    "spec": {
      "cluster": "prod-internal",
      "threshold": 1000,
      "operator": "GreaterThan",
      "metric": "MessageIn",
      "promQl": "sum(rate(kafka_partition_latest_offset{cluster_id=\"shadow-julien\"}[1m])) > 1000",
      "description": "Miguel knows how to fix this",
      "displayName": null,
      "destination": {
        "url": "https://example.com/webhook/f0c608e3-aca3-4b07-8d4d-7226f629ade9",
        "method": "POST",
        "headers": {
          "example": "123"
        },
        "authentification": null,
        "type": "Webhook"
      },
      "disable": null,
      "type": "BrokerAlert"
    }
  },
  "status": "resolved"
}
```
