title: Deploy Conduktor on AWS
---


## Overview

This guide will show how to deploy Console in your AWS environment with all the mandatory dependencies. It will demonstrate how to deploy Conduktor as a Docker container on ECS with Fargate and configure it alongside a PostgreSQL database via RDS.

Our recommendation is to [deploy with Kubernetes](/guide/conduktor-in-production/deploy-artifacts/deploy-console/kubernetes).

You can follow this guide or [view the instructions for Marktetplace listing (AWS CloudFormation)](#deploy-on-aws-cloudformation).

<Info>
While this guide will help you get started, you may need to make additional configurations to ensure your deployment is [production-ready](/guide/conduktor-in-production/index).
</Info>

The process should take no more than 30 minutes.

<Note>
Before you proceed, it is important to make sure that you have either already created a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or are planning to use an existing one. This is important to ensure that your environment is secure and isolated. We also **strongly recommend** avoiding the use of the default VPC, as it can pose a security risk due to its common configuration.
</Note>

##### Step 1: Create a PostgreSQL database via Amazon RDS

<Info>
You can skip this step if you already have an RDS database running you want to use.
</Info>

Let's start by deploying a database on RDS that Conduktor will use to store its state.

As per the system requirements, the PostgreSQL DB needs to be version **13 or higher**. 

Please be aware that Console is compatible only with PostgreSQL engines of version 14.8 or 15.3 and above **within RDS**; other versions may not be fully supported.

Go to the RDS menu and create a new database.

- Select **PostgreSQL**
- In the **Template** section, select **Free Tier** if you are just evaluating Conduktor.

Under Settings, configure:

- **Master username**: `conduktor`
- **Master password**: `change_me`

The default PostgreSQL database port is **5432**.

![AWS Guide RDS](/images/aws-guide-0.png)

Under **Additional configuration**, configure:

- **Initial database name**: `postgres`

![AWS Guide RDS Config](/images/aws-guide-1.png)

Once your database instance is up and running (it takes a few minutes), click on your new database and copy the endpoint generated by AWS in the **Connectivity & Security** panel, e.g. `conduktor.xxx.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com`.

##### Step 2: Create a new Task definition on ECS

Now that we have our database, it's time to deploy Conduktor using Docker containers and ECS (Amazon Elastic Container Service).

Go to Amazon Elastic Container Service:

- Select **Task Definitions**
- Click on **Create new task definition**

In the **Infrastructure Requirements** section:

- Define the ECS family name as `conduktor`, this will be useful to update our deployment with newer versions of Conduktor.
- Specify the infrastructure requirements relevant to your deployment. As per system requirements, we recommend a minimum of **2x CPU cores** and **4GB of RAM**.

##### Step 2.1: Add the core console container

In the **Container Details** section:

- Define the name of the container to `conduktor-console`
- Specify the Image URI and version for Conduktor Console. You should use the most recent major/minor version. E.g.: `conduktor/conduktor-console:<tag>`.
- Add a Port mapping on **8080**. This is the port of the UI of Conduktor Console.

![AWS Guide RDS Container](/images/aws-guide-3.png)

In the **Environment Variables** section, add the essential environment variables required to run Conduktor and connect to its PostgreSQL database on RDS.

- `CDK_ADMIN_EMAIL`: yourname@yourcompany.com
- `CDK_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: admin
- `CDK_DATABASE_HOST`: the endpoint you retrieved earlier, like conduktor-xxx.yyy.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com
- `CDK_DATABASE_NAME`: postgres
- `CDK_DATABASE_PASSWORD`: change_me
- `CDK_DATABASE_PORT`: 5432
- `CDK_DATABASE_USERNAME`: conduktor
- `CDK_MONITORING_ALERT-MANAGER-URL`: http://localhost:9010/
- `CDK_MONITORING_CALLBACK-URL`: http://localhost:8080/monitoring/api/
- `CDK_MONITORING_CORTEX-URL`: http://localhost:9009/
- `CDK_MONITORING_NOTIFICATIONS-CALLBACK-URL`: http://localhost:8080
- `CDK_LICENSE`: Enterprise license key (Exclude if you are using Free)

![AWS Guide Env Var](/images/aws-guide-4.png)

<Info>
You can also add your Kafka cluster, schema registry, Kafka Connect and ksqlDB configurations as environment variables. If you're just getting started, we recommend you use the wizard inside the Console UI instead. The wizard provides support for uploading certificates, and help on debugging your connections.
</Info>

##### Step 2.2: Add the Conduktor Cortex monitoring image

Under your first container definition, select **+ Add container** so we can also specify the docker image required to get monitoring benefits inside Conduktor.

In the **Container Details** section:

- Define the name of the container to `conduktor-monitoring`
- Specify the Image URI and version for conduktor monitoring. You should use the most recent major/minor version. E.g:. `conduktor/conduktor-console-cortex:<tag>`.

Add these port mappings:

- 9090 | TCP | conduktor-cortex-9090-tcp
- 9010 | TCP | conduktor-cortex-9010-tcp
- 9009 | TCP | conduktor-cortex-9009-tcp

![AWS Guide Port Mappings](/images/aws-guide-5.png)

In the **Environment variables** section, add the required environment variable to link the monitoring container with the Console container.

- `CDK_CONSOLE-URL`: http://localhost:8080

![AWS Guide Task](/images/aws-guide-cortex.png)

For production environments, you should also configure an external S3 bucket to store historical monitoring data.

We can now go down below and **Create** our task definition.

![AWS Guide Task](/images/aws-guide-6.png)

Whenever you want to change something in your configuration, edit your task definition and create a new version containing your changes.

##### Step 3: Create an ECS cluster and setup Conduktor service

We created a task definition, but it's still just a "template". Now, we need a cluster to deploy it. We'll use ECS with Fargate.

Go to **Settings** > **Clusters** and create a cluster (use the default options):

- **Name**: conduktor-ecs
- In the **Infrastructure** section, make sure AWS Fargate (serverless) is selected (default)
 Create the cluster, it might take a few seconds.

We now have a cluster to deploy our container. Our last step is to create a Service that will reference the Task Definition defined in the previous step.

- Click on your new cluster `conduktor-ecs`
- Create a new **Service**
- In the second section, **Deployment configuration**, make sure the Application type is Service, and select our Task Definition `conduktor-console` in the Family dropdown
- Assign a unique name like Console to be able to identify it properly later on
- Let the rest of the options by default and click on Create at the bottom

![AWS Guide Task Definition](/images/aws-guide-7.png)

This will take a few minutes before the deployment is effective and Conduktor becomes available.

##### Step 4: Access Conduktor and configure Kafka Clusters

From within the **Services > Tasks** screen,  find the Container and navigate to the **Network bindings** tab.

![AWS Guide Breadcrumb](/images/aws-guide-8.png)

Click on the **External** link to open the Console application.

![AWS Guide Network Bindings](/images/aws-guide-9.png)

In our example, our application is running at `3.122.113.99:8080`.

You can now log in as admin with the credentials previously defined in the environment variables, e.g. `yourname@yourcompany.com` / `admin`.

![AWS Guide Breadcrumb](/images/aws-guide-10.png)

Select the **Configure clusters** option and start adding your Kafka cluster configurations.

##### Step 5: Onboard your team

Now that you have an up-and-running deployment of Console, it's time to invite your team!

- Configure SSO to easily onboard users
- Configure local users, if you are not using SSO

### Troubleshoot

<Accordion title="Can't access database or Console">
  You may need to add inbound rules. <br></br>
  For example, in the **security group** attached to the console service, ensure there is an inbound rule (TCP) for port **8080**. 
  In the **security group** attached to the RDS instance, ensure an inbound rule (Type = PostgreSQL) for port **5432**.
</Accordion>

## Deploy on AWS CloudFormation

You can deploy Console using [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

This guide contains a brief overview of the marketplace listing architecture followed by the steps on how to deploy Console in your AWS environment with all the mandatory dependencies. It will deploy Conduktor as a Docker container on an ECS service with Fargate and configure it alongside a PostgreSQL database via RDS.

<Info>
This Conduktor marketplace offering is the Community version and this guide is intended to help you get started. Additional configurations might be required to ensure your deployment is production ready.
</Info>

You can [download a template](https://conduktor-marketplace.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/templates/full_template/conduktor-console_full-template-latest.yaml) to use, just update it with your own values. This template is designed to be deployed in only a few clicks. You may, however, need to wait a few minutes for AWS to spin up the resources.

<Note>
In this configuration, all the resources are on a public subnet. However, the DB instance is available on both private and public subnets. Keep this in mind as part of any security concerns for the database.
</Note>

![AWS Deployment](/images/conduktor.ecs.png)

### Deployment steps

1. Visit the [Marketplace listing page](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-xjv65ie5rjtxu).

2. Select `View purchase options`.

    ![AWS Marketplace](/images/aws-marketplace-1.png)

3. Accept the terms of service.

    ![AWS Marketplace](/images/aws-marketplace-2.png)

4. Select `Continue to Configuration`.

    ![AWS Marketplace](/images/aws-marketplace-3.png)

5. `Continue to Launch`. There is only one supported Software Version and fulfillment option available.

    ![AWS Marketplace](/images/aws-marketplace-4.png)

6. You now can choose how you want to deploy the CloudFormation template. We offer a quicklink that will take you directly to the CloudFormation console with the template pre-filled on your last previously used region (What this guide will be covering). We also offer the raw CloudFormation template that you can download and deploy manually. Select `Quick launch CloudFormation template`.

    ![AWS Marketplace](/images/aws-marketplace-5.png)

7. This will open you up to the CloudFormation page with the template pre-filled. Press `Next`.

    ![AWS Marketplace](/images/aws-marketplace-6.png)

8. You will then be given the option to change the stack name or any of the other default values from our template. You will need to provide values for the missing CIDR properties towards the bottom of the page. Once you are happy with the parameters, press `Next`.

    <Warning>
    The default value for the region is specified in the template as `eu-west-1a` (public subnet) and `eu-west-1b`(private subnet). If you're deploying in a different region, you have to update these values.
    </Warning>

    ![AWS Marketplace](/images/aws-marketplace-7.png)

9. Configure your stack options and acknowledge that the CloudFormation template will create IAM resources and click **Next**.

    ![AWS Marketplace](/images/aws-marketplace-8.png)

10. You can then review the CloudFormation stack and then click **Submit**.

    ![AWS Marketplace](/images/aws-marketplace-9.png)

11. Wait for all resources to be created. This may take some time, about 10 minutes depending how quickly AWS deploys RDS.

    ![AWS Marketplace](/images/aws-marketplace-10.png)

12. From the **Resources** tab, click on `${AWS::StackName}-conduktor-ecs-cluster`. From **Cluster**, navigate to your newly created **Service** and then to the **Task**. Be sure to click on the links.  

    ![Alt Cluster](/images/aws-marketplace-11.png)
    ![Alt Service](/images/aws-marketplace-12.png)
    ![Alt Task](/images/aws-marketplace-13.png)

13. Find the `conduktor-console` Container and (not the *conduktor-console-cortex* one) and navigate to the **Network bindings** tab.

    ![AWS Guide Breadcrumb](/images/aws-marketplace-14.png)

14. Click on the **External** link to open the Console application. In this example, our application is running at 54.155.197.172:8080.

    ![AWS Guide Network Bindings](/images/aws-marketplace-15.png)

### Access Conduktor

You will now be greeted with the create admin login. Create credentials and **make a note/save them** as they are for this instance. If lost, Conduktor cannot remotely reset these credentials.

From here, you can add additional local users if needed. When you're ready for a production level deployment, you'll want to connect to SSO for importing your organization's existing users and groups.
