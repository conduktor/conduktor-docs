## Overview

Conduktor <GlossaryTerm>Console</GlossaryTerm> can help you reprocess messages within a <GlossaryTerm>topic</GlossaryTerm>.

This could be used for reprocessing messages from an existing <GlossaryTerm>DLQ</GlossaryTerm> or for pushing messages into another topic.

## Select a message to reprocess and a new target topic

In Console, go to **Topics** and click on the the message. In the drawer window, click **Reprocess message** at the bottom. 

In the next page, select the **target topic** that you want to publish the message to.

Here, we want to reprocess the message in the `customers` topic.

import SelectTargetTopic from '/images/select-target-topic.png';

<img src={SelectTargetTopic} alt="Select Target Topic" style={{ width: 400, display: 'block', margin: 'auto' }} />

## Edit and process the message

The previous step leads us to the **Produce** page of the target topic, with an auto-populated form containing our record. From there, we can easily modify its key, value and headers.

When you're ready, you can press the **Produce** button and you will see your record being produced. Go to the **Consume** page of this topic in order to retrieve your reprocessed record.
