The resources reference page lists all the concepts that can be manipulated in Console, as well as how to manage them using an Infra as Code (IaC) approach.

There are two kinds of API keys that you can use with the Conduktor CLI, the API and Terraform:

- **AdminToken** - have all the permissions over all the resources in Console. In general, *AdminToken* can bypass application owners.
- **AppToken** - permissions are limited to application instances and ownership is defined via Self-service

## Resource categories

Our resources can be managed via the CLI, the API, Terraform (using the API keys), or Console UI (which relies on RBAC).

There are three categories:

- [Console resources](/guide/reference/console-reference) exist only in Console. For example, users, groups, permissions, cluster configurations, alerts. data masking policies.
- [Kafka resources](/guide/reference/kafka-reference) get created in the Kafka ecosystem, e.g.: topics, subjects, connectors.
- [Self-service resources](/guide/reference/self-service-reference) such as application groups and topic policies.

## Conduktor labels

Conduktor labels let you add functional context to your resources. 

They allow you to sort, filter, categorize and organize your resources, providing the flexibility and freedom to flag data that's important or relevant to you.

We're continuously working towards full label support for all Conduktor resources in Console UI.
 
In the meantime, here's what's currently covered.

- Full (labels supported fully): ✅  
- Partial (labels are supported by the API/CLI but not Console UI): ⚠️
- Missing (labels aren't supported): 🚫
