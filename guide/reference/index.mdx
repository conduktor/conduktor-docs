The resources reference page lists all the concepts that can be manipulated in Console, as well as how to manage them using an Infra as Code (IaC) approach.

There are two kinds of API keys that you can use with the Conduktor CLI, the API and Terraform:

- **AdminToken** - have all the permissions over all the resources in Console. In general, *AdminToken* can bypass application owners.
- **AppToken** - permissions are limited to application instances and ownership is defined via Self-service

## Resource categories

Our resources can be managed via the CLI, the API, Terraform (using the API keys), or Console UI (which relies on RBAC).

There are three categories:

- [Console resources](/guide/reference/console-reference) exist only in Console. For example, users, groups, permissions, cluster configurations, alerts. data masking policies.
- [Kafka resources](/guide/reference/kafka-reference) get created in the Kafka ecosystem, e.g.: topics, subjects, connectors.
- [Self-service resources](/guide/reference/self-service-reference) such as application groups and topic policies.

## Conduktor labels

Conduktor Console labels allow you to add metadata, filter, categorize and organize your resources. Check the following table for the list of currently supported resources.

- "FullLabelSupport"
- "PartialLabelSupport"
- "MissingLabelSupport"
