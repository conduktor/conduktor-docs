These are high-level Gateway object specifications for Conduktor CLI.

## Deploy Interceptor

- **API key(s):** AdminToken 
- **Managed with:** API, CLI, UI

Deploys an Interceptor on Gateway.

````yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway/v2
kind: Interceptor
metadata:
  name: enforce-partition-limit
  # scope:
  #   vCluster: aaa
  #   group: bbb
  #   username: ccc
spec:
  pluginClass: "io.conduktor.gateway.interceptor.safeguard.CreateTopicPolicyPlugin"
  priority: 100
  config:
    topic: "myprefix-.*"
    numPartition:
      min: 5
      max: 5
      action: "INFO"
````

**Interceptor checks:**

- `metadata.scope` is optional (default empty). 
- `metadata.scope.[vCluster | group | username]` combine with each other to define the targeting
  - Check the dedicated [Interceptor targeting](#interceptor-targeting) section
- `spec.pluginClass` is **mandatory**. Has to be a valid Interceptor class name.
- `spec.priority` is **mandatory**
- `spec.config` is a valid config for the `pluginClass`

### Interceptor targeting

You can activate your Interceptor only in specific scenarios. Use the table below to configure Targeting settings.

| Use case                                            | `metadata.scope.vcluster` | `metadata.scope.group` | `metadata.scope.username` |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Global Interceptor (Including Virtual Clusters)     | Set to `null`             | Set to `null`          | Set to `null`             |
| Global Interceptor (**Excluding** Virtual Clusters) | Empty                     | Empty                  | Empty                     |
| Username targeting                                  | Empty                     | Empty                  | Set                       |
| Group targeting                                     | Empty                     | Set                    | Empty                     |
| Virtual Cluster targeting                           | Set                       | Empty                  | Empty                     |
| Virtual Cluster + Username targeting                | Set                       | Empty                  | Set                       |
| Virtual Cluster + Group targeting                   | Set                       | Set                    | Empty                     |

You can deploy multiple interceptors with the same name using a different targeting scope. This will effectively override the configuration for the scope.

<Info>
The order of precedence from highest (overrides all others) to lowest (most easily overridden) is:

- ServiceAccount
- Group
- VirtualCluster
- Global

## GatewayServiceAccount

 When using **Oauth**, **mTLS** or delegated backing Kafka authentication, `GatewayServiceAccount` is generally optional.

GatewayServiceAccount resource is enabled/disabled depending on your Gateway configuration. 

This is to prevent you from declaring a resource that's incompatible with your current configuration:

| GATEWAY_SECURITY         | LOCAL GatewayServiceAccount | EXTERNAL GatewayServiceAccount    |
| -------------------------|----|--------------------------|
| PLAINTEXT                | ðŸš« | ðŸš«                       |
| SSL                      | ðŸš« | only if mTls             |
| SASL_PLAINTEXT           | âœ… | only if OAuth configured |
| SASL_SSL                 | âœ… | only if OAuth configured |
| DELEGATED_SASL_PLAINTEXT | ðŸš« | âœ…                       |
| DELEGATED_SASL_SSL       | ðŸš« | âœ…                       |

Here are a few cases where **you have to** declare GatewayServiceAccount objects:

- creating local service accounts
- renaming service accounts for easier clarity when using Interceptors
- attaching service accounts to Virtual Clusters

<Tabs>
<Tab title="CLI">
```yaml
---
# External user renamed
apiVersion: gateway/v2
kind: GatewayServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: application1
spec:
  type: EXTERNAL
  externalNames:
  - 00u9vme99nxudvxZA0h7
---
# Local User on Virtual Cluster vc-B
apiVersion: gateway/v2
kind: GatewayServiceAccount
metadata:
  vCluster: vc-B
  name: admin
spec:
  type: LOCAL
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Terraform">
```
  resource "conduktor_gateway_service_account_v2" "application1-sa" {
    name = "application1"
    spec = {
      type = "EXTERNAL"
      external_names = [ "00u9vme99nxudvxZA0h7" ]
    }
  }

  resource "conduktor_gateway_service_account_v2" "admin-sa" {
    name = "admin"
    vcluster = "vc-B"
    spec = {
      type = "LOCAL"
    }
  }

  # Generate local service account token
  resource "conduktor_gateway_token_v2" "admin-sa-token" {
    vcluster         = "vc-B"
    username         = "user10"
    lifetime_seconds = 3600
  }

  # Define output to use generated local service account token
  output "admin_sa_token" {
    value     = conduktor_gateway_token_v2.admin-sa-token.token
    sensitive = true
  }
  ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**GatewayServiceAccount checks:**

- When `spec.type` is `EXTERNAL`:
  - `spec.externalNames` must be a non-empty list of external names. Each name must be unique across all declared GatewayServiceAccount.
  - we currently only support a list of one element.

**GatewayServiceAccount side effects:**


- When `spec.type` is `EXTERNAL`:
  - During Client connection, the authenticated user will be checked against the list of `externalNames` to decide which GatewayServiceAccount it is.
- When `spec.type` is `LOCAL`:
  - Access to `/gateway/v2/tokens` endpoint to generate a password for this service account
  - Switching a GatewayServiceAccount `spec.type` from `LOCAL` to `EXTERNAL` does not invalidate previously emitted tokens. They will keep on working for their TTL.

## GatewayGroup

Gateway group lets you add multiple users in the same GatewayGroup for easier Interceptor targeting capabilities.

```yaml
---
# Users added to the group manually
apiVersion: gateway/v2
kind: GatewayGroup
metadata:
  name: group-a
spec:
  members:
    - name: admin
    - vCluster: vc-B
      name: "0000-AAAA-BBBB-CCCC"
````

**GatewayGroup checks:**

- `spec.members[].name` is mandatory.
  - Currently, the username needs to refer to an existing GatewayServiceAccount otherwise it will fail. This is a known issue that we'll address in a further release.
- `spec.members[].vCluster` is optional. It has to refer to an existing Virtual Cluster. When not using Virtual Clusters, don't set this attribute.

**GatewayGroup side effects:**

- All members of the group will be affected by Interceptors deployed with this group's scope.

## ConcentrationRule

Concentration Rules allow you to define patterns where topic creation won't generate a physical topic, but will instead use our topic concentration feature.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway/v2
kind: ConcentrationRule
metadata:
  # vCluster: vc-B
  name: toutdanstiti
spec:
  pattern: titi-.*
  physicalTopics:
    delete: titi-delete
    compact: titi-compact
    deleteCompact: titi-cd
  autoManaged: false
  offsetCorrectness: false
````

**ConcentrationRule checks:**

- `metadata.vCluster` is optional. Must refer to an existing Virtual Cluster. When not using Virtual Clusters, don't set this attribute.
- `spec.physicalTopics.delete` is mandatory. Has to be a valid topic name with a `cleanup.policy` set to `delete`.
- `spec.physicalTopics.compact` is optional. Has ti be a valid topic name with a `cleanup.policy` set to `compact`.
- `spec.physicalTopics.deleteCompact` is optional. Has to be a valid topic name with a `cleanup.policy` set to `delete,compact`.
- `spec.autoManaged` is optional, default is `false`.
- `spec.offsetCorrectness` is optional, default is `false`.

**ConcentrationRule side effects:**

- Once the Concentration Rule is deployed, topics created with a name matching the `spec.pattern` will not be created as real Kafka topics but as concentrated topics instead.  
- Depending on the topic's `cleanup.policy`, the topic's data will be stored in one of the configured physical topics.
- If a topic creation request is made with a `cleanup.policy` that isn't configured in the ConcentrationRule, topic creation will fail.
- It is not possible to update `cleanup.policy` of a concentrated topic.
- If `spec.autoManaged` is set to `true`, the underlying physical topics and configurations will be automatically created and/or extended to honour the topics configurations.
- If `spec.offsetCorrectness` is set to `true`, Gateway will maintain a list of offsets for each of the concentrated topic records.
  - This allows for a proper calculation of message count and consumer group lag.
  - There are some limitations with offset correctness.
- If `spec.offsetCorrectness` is set to `false`, Gateway will report the offsets of the backing topic records.

<Warning>
If a *ConcentrationRule* spec changes, it will not affect previously created concentrated topics, it will only affect the topics created after the change.
</Warning>

## VirtualCluster

A Virtual Cluster allows you to isolate one or more service accounts within a logical cluster. Any topic or consumer group created within a Virtual Cluster will be accessible only to that specific Virtual Cluster.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway/v2
kind: VirtualCluster
metadata:
 name: "mon-app-A"
spec:
 aclEnabled: true # (uses aclMode to determine how the acls are enabled or defaults to KAFKA_API if it is not set)
 aclMode: KAFKA_API # Means ACLs can be edited by the superUsers using kafka-acls command or equivalent 
 superUsers: # This doesn't create users within the Virtual Cluster. You still need to create the gateway service account.
 - username1
 - username2
```

**VirtualCluster checks:**

- `metadata.name` must be a valid topic prefix.
- `spec.aclEnabled` is optional, default `false`.

**VirtualCluster side effects:**

- All topics and consumer groups will be created on the physical Kafka with a prefix `metadata.name`. But, they will appear on the VirtualCluster without the prefix.
- Users can be associated to the VirtualCluster through the GatewayServiceAccount resource.
- When `spec.aclEnabled` is set to `true`, you can configure the superUsers using the `spec.superUsers` list. You will have to manage the ACLs of other service accounts as you would with any other Kafka.

## AliasTopic

An Alias Topic allows a real Kafka topic to appear as a logical topic within Gateway. This is useful for aliasing topics or making a topic accessible within a Virtual Cluster.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway/v2
kind: AliasTopic
metadata:
  name: name1
  vCluster: vCluster1
spec:
  physicalName: physicalName1
```
