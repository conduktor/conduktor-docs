In Console, the **ksqlDB** home page shows the list of ksqlDB clusters, if any have been configured.

<Info>
Configure [RBAC](/guide/conduktor-in-production/admin/set-up-rbac) to restrict access to certain clusters.
</Info>

Click the required ksqlDB entry to see the the details, such as:

- version
- number of streams
- amount of tables
- number of queries

The page consists of several tabs that let you visualize all the currently running queries and write your own or executes statements.

- [Streams and tables tabs](#streams-and-tables-tabs) let you view and manage the running streams and tables.
- [Queries tab](#queries-tab) shows all the queries currently running on the selected ksqlDB cluster.
- [Editor tab](#editor-tab) lets you run queries and execute statements.

By default, the **Streams** tab will be open, allowing you to view and manage all the streams and related topics, key/value formats as well as the number of read/write queries. Click on a row to see the details for each stream.

## Streams and tables tabs

These two tabs are similar but show different resources. The **Streams** one shows the result of `CREATE STREAM` statements and the **Tables** one is about `CREATE TABLE` statements.

The details include:

- name of the stream/table
- topic that this steam/table write data into
- key and value formats
- number of ksqlDB queries that write into this stream/table
- number of queries that read from this stream/table

You can **click an item to view its details** or delete the selected stream/table by clicking on the **trash can**.

### Streams and tables details page

This page consists of three tabs:

- **Fields** shows the structure (name and type) of the selected stream/table.
- **kSQL** displays the exact kSQL statement running behind the scenes.
- **Metrics** provides runtime statistics for the topic backing the selected stream/table.

Click **Terminate** at the top of the page to delete the stream/table. You'll be prompted to confirm your choice as it can't be undone.

## Queries tab

This tab shows all the currently running queries the selected ksqlDB cluster. The table shows:

- Query ID.
- Output topic: the topic into which the query is writing to.
- Type: either **Persistent** for the queries originating from `CREATE` statements or **Push** for queries executed by users in the query editor or via calls to `/query-stream` endpoint.

Click on the query to see field details (name and type) and the source KSQL code. Click **Terminate** at the top of the page to delete the stream/table. You'll be prompted to confirm your choice as it can't be undone.

## Editor tab

This tab lets you run queries and execute statements.

### Run a query

To run a `Push` or `Pull` query, select **Run a query**, paste or type the required commands and click **Run**. This will send requests to the `/query-stream` endpoint of ksqlDB.

You can change the **start from** to be **earliest** or **latest**.

The records will appear at the bottom in the **Results** section.

### Execute a statement

To run a sequence of SQL statements, select **Execute a statement**, paste or type the required scripts and click **Run**.

The `/ksql` endpoint of ksqlDB will be used.

Look out for a success or fail alert at the bottom of the screen.
