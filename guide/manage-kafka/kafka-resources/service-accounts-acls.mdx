title: Service accounts and ACLs
---

Console lets you manage service accounts and ACLs (Access Control Lists).

What you see on the **Service Accounts** page will depend on whether you have [configured a Kafka provider, such as Confluent or Aiven](#provider-integrations).

## View service accounts and manage ACLs

The **Service Accounts** page in Console offers a powerful design that aggregates ACLs to principal granularity. This lets you easily understand all the resource ACLs assigned to each service account.

After selecting a service account, you can **edit** existing ACLs and **add new** resource ACLs. When you create new ACLs for a resource, you can:

- Use pre-configured permissions (e.g. Consumer, Producer, Admin)
- Manually define permissions

To manually edit permissions, select the operation and choose **Allow**, **Deny** or **Not Set**.

## Provider integrations

Connect your Kafka provider to manage their benefits directly in Conduktor Console. The additional functionality you get from connecting your provider is made possible via their APIs.

To use Kafka provider service account functionality, you have to configure the provider. Go to **Settings** > **Clusters**, select a cluster and use the **Provider** tab.
