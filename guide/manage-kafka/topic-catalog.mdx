title: Topic Catalog
---

## Overview

The Topic Catalog provides organization-wide topic discovery with ownership visibility and business metadata management. Teams can quickly find Kafka topics within your organization, understand ownership, and access relevant business context through searchable metadata.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Centralized Discovery**: Find all topics across clusters from a single interface
- **Ownership Transparency**: Clear visibility on who owns and manages each topic
- **Business Context**: Add and search by custom business metadata and labels
- **Team Organization**: Organize topics by applications and teams for better governance

## Prerequisites

- Conduktor Console with appropriate permissions
- Topics configured across one or more Kafka clusters
- Application and team structure defined in Console

## Add Topics to Applications

Navigate to **Applications** in Console to organize topics by associating them with specific applications.

Example application topic configuration:

```yaml
application: "order-processing-service"
topics:
  - name: "orders.created"
    cluster: "prod-kafka"
    labels:
      - "customer-data"
      - "high-volume"
      - "pii-containing"
  - name: "orders.cancelled"
    cluster: "prod-kafka" 
    labels:
      - "customer-data"
      - "audit-required"
```

Multi-cluster topic management for the same application:

```yaml
application: "user-analytics"
topics:
  - name: "user.events"
    cluster: "analytics-kafka-us"
    labels: ["analytics", "gdpr-sensitive"]
  - name: "user.events" 
    cluster: "analytics-kafka-eu"
    labels: ["analytics", "gdpr-sensitive", "eu-region"]
```

## Business Metadata and Labels

Add business-relevant labels to topics for better discovery and governance:

**Data Classification Labels:**
- `pii-containing`: Personal information present
- `financial-data`: Financial or payment information
- `audit-required`: Subject to audit requirements
- `gdpr-sensitive`: GDPR compliance required

**Business Domain Labels:**
- `customer-journey`: Customer experience data
- `inventory-management`: Product and stock data
- `order-processing`: Order lifecycle events
- `analytics`: Data used for analytics/ML

**Operational Labels:**
- `high-volume`: >10K messages/minute
- `critical-path`: Business-critical data flow
- `experimental`: Testing or experimental data
- `deprecated`: Scheduled for removal

## Search and Discovery

The Topic Catalog supports powerful search capabilities across names, labels, and metadata.

Search by topic name patterns:

```
orders.created
user.events
payment.*
```

Search by labels with filtering:

```
label:pii-containing
label:high-volume
label:gdpr-sensitive AND label:customer-data
```

Search by metadata fields:

```
owner:payments-team
cluster:prod-kafka
application:user-service
```

Combined search across multiple criteria:

```
payment label:audit-required owner:finance-team
```

## Topic Ownership and Governance

Assign clear ownership for governance and incident response by selecting topics in the catalog and setting primary owners and secondary contacts.

Team-based discovery example showing organized topic structure:

```yaml
Team: "payments-engineering"
Applications:
  - payment-processor
    Topics: ["payments.authorized", "payments.settled", "payments.failed"]
  - fraud-detection  
    Topics: ["transactions.suspicious", "fraud.alerts"]
    
Related Topics: ["orders.payment-required", "users.payment-methods"]
```

## Best Practices

Establish consistent naming patterns for better discovery:

```bash
# Domain-based naming
payments.transactions.created
payments.transactions.failed
users.profiles.updated
users.sessions.started

# Event-sourcing pattern  
order-service.domain-events.OrderCreated
order-service.domain-events.OrderCancelled
payment-service.domain-events.PaymentProcessed
```

## Troubleshoot Common Issues

**Topics Not Appearing:**
- Verify cluster connectivity in Console
- Check topic permissions and access rights
- Ensure applications are properly configured

**Search Not Working:**
- Verify indexing is complete for new topics
- Check search syntax and filter combinations
- Ensure proper permissions to view search results
