#### Fixes üî®

- Fixed an issue on the consumer group list screen which could inflate the number of members in a group. This was a result of migrating to the internal 'snapshot' cache for improved performance, and missing a case whereby we did not clean up old consumer group members.

#### Known issues ‚öôÔ∏è

- Upon adding a new Kafka Cluster, Built-in Alerts & Custom Alerts are not working. You must restart Conduktor after adding the Kafka Cluster for changes to take effect.
