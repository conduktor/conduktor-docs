# Overview

Chaos testing Interceptors in Conduktor are like stress tests for your data systems. Imagine you're testing a car by driving it over rough roads to see how it handles bumps and potholes. Similarly, chaos testing interceptors create "bumps" in your data flow to see how well your applications can handle problems like slow data delivery, corrupted messages, or unexpected duplicates. This helps ensure that your systems are strong and can keep running smoothly even when things go wrong.
