Conduktor is the Enterprise Data Management platform for Kafka data streaming that integrates with your existing infrastructure to provide centralized visibility and control over real-time data.

It's a fully self-hosted solution that depends on Docker to run. You can [get started for free](https://www.conduktor.io/get-started) using the Conduktor Community version.
