Partner Zones allow you to share Kafka topics with external partners selectively and securely. You can:

- set up **dedicated zones** with **customized access** to Kafka topics
- create a **single source of truth** because data isn't duplicated
- **reduce operational costs**, since you don't have to keep data streams synchronized
