## Ops Monitoring

To support understanding of your Kafka infrastructure healthiness, we can help you monitor:

- Cluster health state
- Partitions health state
- Topic activity
- Topic storage

See [metrics](metrics.md) for more information.

## Application Monitoring

To support understanding of your Kafka applications state, we help you monitor:

- Consumer group state
- Consumer group lag

See [metrics](metrics.md) for more information.

## Alerting

We enable real-time notifications on built-in and custom alerts. Alerts can be made at a topic granularity and with configurable thresholds. We currently support alerting via **Slack** and **MS Teams**.
