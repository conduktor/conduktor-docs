### Proxy Overview

Conduktor Proxy sits between your Kafka deployment and the clients it serves. By having a complete view over all the traffic in and out of the cluster, Conduktor Proxy can provide insights that are not available anywhere else.

Conduktor proxy is 100% compatible with the Apache Kafka wire protocol. This means that it can analyse, react to and modify client interactions to provide a fuller data streaming experience. You can explore more of the features of Conduktor Proxy [here](./features/features.md)
