## What is Conduktor Console?

The Conduktor Console is a powerful UI for Apache Kafka. The Console equips users with functionality to support many essential tasks when working with Kafka.

**Access and Manage Kafka resource**. Explore topics, reset consumer offsets, manage ACLs, deploy & restart connectors, are just some of the things you can do.

**Self-service**. Solve some of the most recurring problems associated with working with Kafka at scale. Ownership of resources, access request management, topic discvoerability, governance policies, and much more!

**Secure Kafka**. Import your existing groups, configure detailed permissions for your users, set up your external integrations, review audit logs as well as much more.

**Monitor Kafka**. The cluster, topics and consumer groups. Creating alerts to notify you based on Kafka metrics we collect for you.

See [Navigation](/platform/navigation/) for more details.
