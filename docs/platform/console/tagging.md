# Tagging

Conduktor enables you to tag resources such as Topics with additional metadata. This can be useful for grouping resources with common attributes. For example, adding a tag to identify resources belonging to a specific team, project or origin. 

Note that tags are **shared amongst your organization**, meaning all colleagues will be able to see tags that are applied to resources.

## Adding Tags

Currently tagging is only supported on topics. Tags can be added during topic creation, or they can be added to any pre-existing topics.

**Adding tags during topic creation**

From within the topic creation slideout, add one or many tags via the form selection:

**Adding tags to existing topics**

From within an existing topic, add one or many tags from the selection that is in-line with topic statistics.
