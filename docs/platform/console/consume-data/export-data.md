Kafka messages can be exported via the consumer view of Console. 

Data can be exported in formats:

 - **CSV**
      - Exported with the schema: timestamp, partition, offset, key, value
  - **JSON**
      - Exported as [JSON lines](https://jsonlines.org/)

To export data, click the breadcrumb from within the table and choose the desired export format. All results that are loaded within the Conduktor UI will be exported.
