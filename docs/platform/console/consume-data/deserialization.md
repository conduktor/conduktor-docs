description: Deserialization in Conduktor Console.

By default, Console will attempt to identify the deserializer **automatically** for both the Key and the Value.

If the deserialization fails, or does not represent the data as you expect, you can manually pick which deserializer to use.

Deserializers are available behind the "More options" button.
