  <Paragraph>
    <strong>Topic as a Service is still in beta</strong>, but is coming soon! Fill in your email to get updates about the release and be the first to know.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Topic as a Service standardizes your foundational processes</strong> for creating topics. Instead of letting every team and
developer run amok, you can ensure every new topic fits with requirements that you define. No more worrying about
naming conventions and no need for topic gatekeepers! It's easy to promote and share topics across teams.
