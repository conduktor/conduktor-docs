## Application Details

The Application Details page summarizes all the information that relates to the Application:
- Application General information
- Application Instances & Ownership
- Subscribed topics
- Shared topics

Additionally, if you belong to the owner Group of the Application, you can generate Application Instance API Keys to use with the CLI to create resources.
