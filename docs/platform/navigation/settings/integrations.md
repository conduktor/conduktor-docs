MS Teams and Slack have two different configuration setups which involve generating either a token or a webhook URL. The details of which are documented within the Conduktor UI.

To begin, select the integration you wish to **Configure** the integration for. You may configure for both Slack and Teams if you wish but only one may remain active at any time. You must have sufficient permissions to setup the integration.

Follow the instructions and **Test your configuration**.

If switching between the integrations you should return to this screen to **Connect**.

With the integration configured you can now receive [Alerts in Monitoring](/platform/navigation/monitoring/getting-started/create-alert/)!
