## Configuring Integrations

Conduktor console can integrate with Slack, MS Teams, and any system that receives webhooks.
MS Teams and webhook integrations can be enabled and disabled from this page with a simple toggle.
_Disabling an integration that is used by existing alerts will not delete those alerts, but it will prevent them from sending external notifications._
Enabling the Slack integration requires generating a token, and instructions for this can be found within the Conduktor UI after initiating a connection.
MS Teams integration can be enabled and disabled on this page, but you will need a webhook URL from Teams when creating alerts with this destination.
Instructions for generating this URL can be found below.


## Slack Integration

Please follow the instructions from the Slack integration setup page in Conduktor console to setup Slack integration. Once connected, you can create alerts with the destination "Slack", and select any channel you want to send the alerts to.

import SlackIntegration from './assets/slack-invite.png';

<img src={SlackIntegration} alt="Slack integration" style={{ width: 400, display: 'block', margin: 'auto', marginBottom: '20px' }} />


In order to receive alert messages, make sure you have added the slack application to the channel you want to send the alerts to. You can do this by typing `/invite` in the channel and choose the application you have just created.


## Microsoft Teams Integration using Workflows

The existing Microsoft 365 (previously called Office 365) connectors and webhooks across all cloud platforms are planned for retirement starting 8/15/2024 with plans to disable the ability to create new connectors and webhooks. Followed by connectors and webhook's functionality ceasing at the end of the year. Power Automate workflows are the intended solution to replace the connectors and webhooks.

This document is focused on how Conduktor console integrates with workflows in place of the webhooks which are used with Microsoft teams to handle alerting from Conduktor's monitoring.

You can send notifications to different rooms for different alerts. However, this room must be a Microsoft Teams "standard room" and not a "shared" room.

### Workflows Setup Instructions

1.  Open the Workflows app within the chat or channel by right-clicking on the conversation, or by clicking on More options (â€¦) then selecting Workflows.

import Workflows1 from './assets/workflows-1.png';

2.  In the Workflow app, click on the "+ New flow" button, or select the Create tab and choose "Post to a channel when a webhook request is received" template.

3.  Choose a name for this flow, you can use the default "Post to a channel when a webhook request is received". And choose who will own this workflow, it should default to the user you are using to log into teams. Then click Next.

4.  Pick which team and which channel to post to, then click on Create flow. This page usually takes a bit to load.

5.  Once you click on click on Create flow from the previous step, the next page should show you the URL for the webhook associated with the workflow you just created. Copy and paste this somewhere as it will be used in a later step. Then click done.

6.  Go back to the Home tab in workflow, and edit the newly created workflow by click on more options(...) then Edit.

7.  On this page:
    1.  Expand the first step "When a Teams webhook request is received" to see the URL endpoint again if you failed to save it from the previous step. You can also change who can trigger the flow, for this example we will use "Anyone".
    2.  Expand the second step and select "attachments" from Select an output from previous steps, then in the sub step select "content" from Adaptive Card. Everything else should be filled in, however here you can choose a different channel if you want to change the options selected during Workflow creation.

8.  Head to the integrations settings in conduktor console and turn on Teams integration. You can now [create alerts](/platform/navigation/settings/alerts/#alert-creation) with the destination "Microsoft Teams" and use the URL found in previous steps. You can test your connection by clicking on the test button.
