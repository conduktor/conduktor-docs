description: Introduction to the different concepts of Conduktor Gateway
---

:::info
The objective of this document is to introduce each concept individually and gradually while keeping the complexity and details to a minimum. 
If you already understand Conduktor Gateway's concepts and you are looking for a detailed reference, check this page instead: Gateway Resource Reference(todo)
:::

## Conduktor Gateway

Conduktor Gateway is a proxy that sits between your Kafka cluster and your clients. It extends the capabilities of Kafka while maintaining a strict compatibility with the Kafka protocol.   

Once configured, the only required change on the Kafka clients is to update the `bootstrap.servers` property to point to the Gateway instead of the upstream Kafka.  
We call the upstream kafka the backing kafka or backing cluster.

Conduktor Gateway extends Kafka to provide new functionalities with different techniques:
- **Interceptors** are pluggable components that augment Kafka by intercepting specific requests of the Kafka protocol and applying operations to it.
- **Core features** like Authentication, Virtual clusters, Logical Topics, Failover... are features that blend much more deeply the Kafka protocol. For that reason we decided should be experienced as a dedicated feature for simplicity and ease of understanding (as opposed to pluggable Interceptors).

Most core features and all interceptors can be configured using the Gateway HTTP API or using the Conduktor CLI.

## Interceptors

Conduktor Gateway has a massive list of Interceptors available. Check our [Interceptor Catalog](/gateway/category/interceptors-catalog/) for more details.

A few examples:
- Full-body or field-level Encryption & Decryption
- Reject (during produce) or Skip (during consume) records that don't match some business data quality rules
- Enforce producer configurations such as acks or compression
- Enforce or override configurations during a CreateTopic requests, such as replication factor or naming convention


To deploy an Interceptor, you need to prepare its configuration. Configuring and deploying an interceptor is a bit similar to what you'd do with Kafka Connect Connectors.

Here's an example for an interceptor whose responsibility is to prevent creation of topics with more than 6 partitions:
TODO (tabbed view for API vs CLI)
- Using the API `POST /interceptors`
````json
{
  "name": "enforce-partition-limit",
  "pluginClass": "io.conduktor.gateway.interceptor.safeguard.CreateTopicPolicyPlugin",
  "priority": 100,
  "config": {
    "topic": ".*",
    "numPartition": {
      "min": 1,
      "max": 6,
      "action": "BLOCK"
    }
}
````
- Using the CLI conduktor gateway apply -f file.yml
````yaml
---
kind: Interceptor
metadata:
  name: enforce-partition-limit
spec:
  pluginClass: "io.conduktor.gateway.interceptor.safeguard.CreateTopicPolicyPlugin",
  priority: 100,
  config:
    topics: ".*"
    numPartition:
      min: 1,
      max: 6,
      action: "BLOCK"
````

Interceptors combine with each others in 3 different ways to create very powerful interactions and solve many interesting use-cases:  **Chaining**, **Targeting** & **Overriding**.

**Interceptor Chaining** lets you deploy multiple interceptors (using different names) with different purpose, where each interceptor performs its action sequentially and independently, and pass its result to the next.
The order of execution is determined by the priority of each interceptor. Lower numbers gets executed first.
![chaining](img/interceptors.png)

**Interceptor Targeting** lets you define which Kafka Clients (ultimately resolved as Service Accounts) must be affected by those interceptors. 
There are 4 targeting scopes available: Global, VirtualCluster, Group & ServiceAccount.  
Check the Reference Documentation for more details.
````yaml
# This interceptors only triggers for service account 'sa-clickstream'
---
kind: Interceptor
metadata:
  user: sa-clickstream
  name: enforce-partition-limit
spec:
  pluginClass: "io.conduktor.gateway.interceptor.safeguard.CreateTopicPolicyPlugin",
  priority: 100,
  config:
    topics: ".*"
    numPartition:
      min: 1,
      max: 20,
      action: "BLOCK"
````

**Interceptor Overriding** lets you change the behavior of an interceptor, by redeploying it with the **same name**, but under a different scope. This effectively overrides the effect of the interceptors with lower precedence.  

:::info
The order of precedence from lowest (most easily overridden) to highest (overrides all others) is:
- Global
- VirtualCluster (More on this below)
- Group (More on this below)
- ServiceAccount
:::

**Example**  
In the example below, we can see how **Chaining**, **Targeting** & **Overriding** interact with each other.
- `interceptor-C` is deployed only for Alice. (Targeting)
- `interceptor-D` is deployed globally, but also deployed specifically for Bob (Overriding)
- `interceptor-A` and `interceptor-B` are deployed globally and finally the priorities are considered for the execution order (Chaining)
![Interceptor example](img/interceptor-example.png)

When you need Interceptors to apply conditionally, targeting by Service Account is the most straightforward way to go.


## Gateway Service Accounts & Authentication

Gateway Service Accounts are tightly coupled to the Authentication method you choose to connect your clients to the Gateway.

:::info
The objective of Authentication, whatever the method used, is to provide Conduktor Gateway with a Service Account **name** to be used in Kafka, and optionally a **set of Groups** and a **Virtual Cluster** to associate to the Service Account.
:::

There are 3 ways to authenticate users with the Gateway:
- **Delegating** authentication to the backing cluster (Confluent Cloud API Keys for instance)
- Using an **External** source of authentication such as OAuth/OIDC, mTLS, LDAP
- Using Gateway **Local** Service Accounts

Check the dedicated [Authentication page](/gateway/concepts/Clients/) to understand how to configure them for Conduktor Gateway.

Each method has its own advantages and limitations, due to the structure of the object returned by the authentication process:

| Authentication | Source of Name | Source of Groups | Source of Virtual Cluster |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Delegated      | âœ…              | ðŸš«               | ðŸš«                        |
| mTLS           | âœ…               | ðŸš«                 | ðŸš«                          |
| External Oauth | âœ…              | âœ…                | âœ…                         |
| Local          | âœ…              | âœ…                | âœ…                        |

:::tip
Once Authentication is configured, if you don't need Group or Virtual Cluster, then no further step is necessary regarding Service Accounts.
:::

There are a few cases where it's necessary to declare GatewayServiceAccount resources: **Local Gateway Users**, **Service Account mapping** or **Virtual Cluster mapping**.

Check the dedicated [Service Accounts](/gateway/concepts/service-accounts) page for more details


**Local Gateway Users**  
If you don't use any form of external authentication (delegated, Oauth, mTLS, ...), but still want authentication (you can also stay with unauthenticated users), then you must declare Local Gateway users.
````yaml
---
kind: GatewayServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  type: LOCAL
---
kind: GatewayServiceAccount
metadata:
 name: bob
spec:
 type: LOCAL
````
You can then generate password using the dedicated endpoint.
````json
PUT /v2/token
{
  "name": "alice"
  "ttl": "3days"
}
````

**Service Account mapping**  
When you don't have any control on the JWT generated by your OIDC provider, and you need map the `sub` of the claim to a more friendly and recognizable name in Kafka.
````json
{
  "aud": "https://myapi.example.com",
  "iss": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/v2.0",
  "sub": "8d5e86b4-6a41-4e94-b6a8-1e5b7723e858",
  "exp": 1643482800,
  "nbf": 1643479200,
  "iat": 1643479200,
  "nonce": "12345"
}
````
Given this JWT token, deploying this `GatewayServiceAccount` resource will map the unreadable sub into a clear name `alice`, which you will then use for Interceptor Targeting, ACLs, ...
````yaml
kind: GatewayServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: alice
spec:
  type: EXTERNAL
  externalMapping: "8d5e86b4-6a41-4e94-b6a8-1e5b7723e858"
````

**Virtual Cluster mapping**  
If you want to use Virtual Cluster feature, deploying this resource will link the service account to the specified Virtual Cluster `vc-alice`.



````yaml
kind: GatewayServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: alice
  vcluster: vc-alice
spec:
  type: EXTERNAL
  externalMapping: "8d5e86b4-6a41-4e94-b6a8-1e5b7723e858"
````



## Virtual Clusters

A Virtual Cluster is a logical representation of a Kafka cluster in Conduktor Gateway. Thanks to this concept, Conduktor Gateway enables Kafka users to create as many (virtual) clusters as they wish while having only a single physical kafka cluster deployed.
![image.png](../medias/vclusters.png)
The primary goal of VClusters is to multiplex several logical Kafka clusters on a single physical Kafka clusters. For that we need to ensure isolation between the different VClusters (like if we enabled multitenancy in Kafka).

To achieve isolation every VCluster has a prefix.

The principle is that any kafka resource (topic, group id, transactional id) whose key starts with a VCluster's prefix will be accessible from this VCluster.
