## Gateway Service Accounts & Authentication

Gateway Service Accounts are tightly coupled to the Authentication method you choose to connect your clients to the Gateway.

:::info
The objective of Authentication, whatever the method used, is to provide Conduktor Gateway with a Service Account **name** to be used in Kafka, and optionally a **set of Groups** and a **Virtual Cluster** to associate to the Service Account.
:::

There are 3 ways to authenticate users with the Gateway:
- **Delegating** authentication to the backing cluster (Confluent Cloud API Keys for instance)
- Using an **External** source of authentication such as OAuth/OIDC, mTLS, LDAP
- Using Gateway **Local** Service Accounts

Each method has its own advantages and limitations, due to the structure of the object returned by the authentication process:

| Authentication | Source of Name | Source of Groups | Source of Virtual Cluster |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Delegated      | âœ…              | ðŸš«               | ðŸš«                        |
| mTLS           | âœ…               | ðŸš«                 | ðŸš«                          |
| External Oauth | âœ…              | âœ…                | âœ…                         |
| Local          | âœ…              | âœ…                | âœ…                        |

Check the dedicated [Authentication Configuration page](/gateway/configuration/client-authentication) to understand how to configure each method.


:::tip
Once Authentication is configured, if you don't need Group or Virtual Cluster, then no further step is necessary regarding Service Accounts.
:::

There are a few cases where it's necessary to declare GatewayServiceAccount resources: **Local Gateway Users**, **Service Account mapping** or **Virtual Cluster mapping**.


**Local Gateway Users**  
If you don't use any form of external authentication (delegated, Oauth, mTLS, ...), but still want authentication (you can also stay with unauthenticated users), then you must declare Local Gateway users.

You can generate a tuple user/password using the dedicated endpoint:
````json
POST /admin/username/alice
{
  "lifeTimeSeconds": 7776000
}
````

**Service Account mapping**  
When you don't have any control on the JWT generated by your OIDC provider, and you need map the `sub` of the claim to a more friendly and recognizable name in Kafka.
````json
{
  "aud": "https://myapi.example.com",
  "iss": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/v2.0",
  "sub": "8d5e86b4-6a41-4e94-b6a8-1e5b7723e858",
  "exp": 1643482800,
  "nbf": 1643479200,
  "iat": 1643479200,
  "nonce": "12345"
}
````
Given this JWT token, deploying this `GatewayServiceAccount` resource will map the unreadable sub into a clear name `alice`, which you will then use for Interceptor Targeting, ACLs, ...
````json
POST /admin/userMappings/v1
{
  "username": "alice",
  "principal": "8d5e86b4-6a41-4e94-b6a8-1e5b7723e858"
}
````

**Virtual Cluster mapping**  
If you want to use Virtual Cluster feature, deploying this resource will link the service account to the specified Virtual Cluster `vc-alice`.

````json
POST /admin/userMappings/v1/vcluster/vc-alice
{
  "username": "alice",
  "principal": "8d5e86b4-6a41-4e94-b6a8-1e5b7723e858",
}s
````
